[{"categories":null,"content":"I thought I\u0026rsquo;d share some more creative writing this week. Below is the beginning of a short story I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on that takes place in the same world as my novel, The Sharpe Chronicles. It\u0026rsquo;s set before the novel takes place and centers around Lucy. Enjoy!\nIt had been a long night and detective Butler was tired, it was now 3:20am, twenty minutes past the end of his shift but unfortunately his Lieutenant had handed him an assignment as he was getting ready to head home. There had been some sort of incident involving a bar in the Mission district. Another detective had been assigned as primary, but the Lieutenant had told Butler to help with the witness interview process. Butler sighed as he heaved himself up from his desk and headed for the interview room.\nButler nodded at the uniformed officer and glanced down at the file in his hand as he walked into the room, “Good morning Mr. …. White, thanks for coming in so early to give your statement.” Butler looked up from his file and smiled at the grizzled old man.\n“Just doing my civic duty; please, call me Alfred.” Alfred responded in a good-natured tone.\nButler relaxed a little; he had been expecting a rant on having to wait so long. “Ok Alfred, let’s start at the beginning- what did you see?”\n“I’ve seen some weird stuff in my day but tonight\u0026hellip;” Alfred fidgeted with the Styrofoam cup of bad station coffee that sat in front of him and frowned. Butler glanced at the officer standing at the door and got a shrug in response.\n“Mr. White…I mean, Alfred\u0026hellip;”\nThe old man interrupted by clearing his throat, “Detective, I joined the army the day I graduated high school. Didn’t do it for the rank like some of the other boys, or the glory the recruiter promised us.”\n“That’s very noble of you Alfred.”\nAlfred waved his hand in dismissal, “That wasn’t what I wanted either, just wanted to serve my country and maybe impress a few girls.” A ghost of a smile crossed his face as he continued to finger his coffee cup. “I’m telling you this, so you know that I’m not someone who likes to tell big stories.”\n“Ok\u0026hellip;.”\n“I am 97 years old and have fought in three different wars: World War 2, Korea, and Vietnam. Let me tell you, I’ve seen some pretty strange things in my time.” Alfred continued with barely a pause. “I once saw a man who was 5 feet from a mortar blast get knocked back 20 feet then just get up and walk away.”\n“Wow, that’s pretty amazing.” Butler said, just to keep the old man talking.\nAlfred shook his head, “But tonight definitely takes the cake.”\n“How so, Alfred?”\n“It probably says in that file you have there, but I work the late shift at Luke’s pub as a line cook, it’s not the best hours but it’s an honest living. Every night for the past 20 years I’ve taken a walk around the neighborhood after my shift. Mind you, the neighborhood has changed a little, but not my route. I walk down 17th street to Mission and then walk all the way down to 23rd street before circling back on Van Ness Ave and walking home.”\nButler looked at his notes, “My notes say the incident was at 24th and Capp St. If you always turn at 23rd, how could you have seen anything?”\n“Because, for the past month I’ve been walking down to 24th to avoid the club.”\n“You mean the club going by the name Belladona?” Butler asked clarifying.\nAlfred nodded, “Yeah…that one that took over the old church.”\n“Why?”\nAlfred shrugged one plaid covered shoulder, “I can’t give you an example or anything, but my gut just said it was some place to stay away from.”\n“Ok, so last night you were walking down 24th Street near the Capp Street crossing…” Butler prompted, scribbling on a notepad.\nAlfred bobbed his head, “Right… so I’m walking down the street, about to cross Capp and I hear shouts from down the block…towards 23rd. Then I hear a loud crash, like a car ran into something. I figured there was an accident, and I might be able to help so I headed up Capp.”\n“What did you find?” Butler prompted after Alfred was quiet for a moment.\nAlfred took a sip of water from the plastic cup sitting on the table in front of him, “I slowed as I got closer to the club. First thing I noticed was a car on fire in the street…”\nButler scribbled another note, “Can you describe the car?”\nAlfred shrugged on shoulder, “I’m not too good with cars, but it was black or dark blue, and it was really nice. A Lexus maybe?”\nButler grunted in acknowledgement and waited for the old man to continue.\n“People weren’t really paying attention to the car though, there were these folks near the door of the club that were looking further down Capp St., so I walked a little further down the other side of the street until I could get a good view.”\n“What did you see?”\nAlfred took another sip of water, “There were these five or six guys all circling around something in the middle of the intersection with 23rd street. They reminded me of a pack of hyenas. As they circled I was able to see between them to what they were focused on.” Alfred paused again, “Mind you, I don’t know what I was expecting, but it certainly wasn’t what I saw! Right in the middle of this group of thugs was this young girl just calm as you could be standing in the middle of the street. How do you like that? I don’t know if I’d be calm with thugs twice my size circling around me.”\nButler paused in his note taking and looked up, “A young girl?”\n“Yeah! I was as surprised as you are! It took me a second for me to get over my shock.”\n“Can you describe her?”\nAlfred scratched his chin, “Well let’s see… she was wearing jeans and a pretty form fitting t-shirt if you know what I mean…and she couldn’t have been older than 26 or 27. I think she had brown hair? Yeah, longish brown hair that was up in a ponytail.”\nButler scribbled down Alfred’s description, “Ok, what happened next?”\n“Well, when I finally got over the shock, I took a couple steps forward. Guess my brain wanted my body to help or somethin’…don’t know how helpful I could be at my age, but I was gonna try. They definitely weren’t there to help the poor girl.”\nButler looked over what he could see of Alfred White, besides a little sweat the old vet seemed perfectly fine, and didn’t seem to be injured or anything. “You seem to have done pretty well for yourself.”\nAlfred let out a bark of laughter, “I wish! I had every intention of lending a hand and getting my butt whipped, but that young woman had it completely handled. The moment I stepped forward they rushed in to attack her and man could they fight!”\nButler frowned and was about to speak when Alfred continued, “Mind you, my eyes aren’t what they used to be, and I was never one for the hand-to-hand fighting, but from what I saw, any one of those guys could have easily gone round for round with any boxing champion…. And you know what?”\n“What?” Butler responded, knowing his queue.\n“Not a single one of them laid a pinky on that woman. It was a sight to behold.”\n“What do you mean, she managed to get away?”\nAlfred shook his head emphatically, “No! She didn’t even attempt to run away. I swear, they would go to punch her, and she just wouldn’t be there anymore. I don’t know how else to explain it, it was like watching a fight movie with frames missing. One second, they would be in one place, then BLAM! They would be standing 10 feet to their left like they’d never moved.”\nButler flicked a glance at the officer standing by the door, “You said your eyes aren’t what they used to be Alfred?”\nAlfred sighed, “Look, I know what I’m telling you sounds out there, and my eyes definitely aren’t as sharp as they used to be. But I still have 20/20, never needed glasses a day in my life.”\nButler stared at Alfred for a second before nodding, “Ok, what happened next?”\n“As I said, it was like watching a fight movie with frames missing… all of a sudden, the thugs started dropping like flies. I didn’t even see the girl throw a punch, but first one thug went flying back, then another slammed into the side of a car. Then a third and fourth went skidding down the street in the opposite direction. Then things got a little weird.”\n“Then things got weird?” Butler asked incredulously.\nAlfred nodded, “The thug that had been thrown against the side of the car? Well, he shouted something in a foreign language out of frustration, I think he called the girl Lucy and picked up the car and threw it at her.”\nThere was silence in the small interview room as Detective Butler processed what Alfred had said.\nFinally, Butler spoke, “Did you say he picked up the car?”\nAlfred nodded and mimed picking up a box on his right with two hands and throwing it to his left, “Yup, I almost didn’t believe it either, but since I was directly in the path of the car as it hit the ground and slid, I got a very good view.” Alfred paused to take another sip of water, “I probably would have been a goner if it hadn’t of been for that girl… I heard her sigh, then all of a sudden, she was right in front of me and the car had stopped and was sitting on its passenger side.”\n“Uh huh…” Butler managed to say.\n“I guess I made a sound or something because the girl turned around and looked at me with this blazing smile on her face.\n“Did she say anything?”\nAlfred smiled, “Yeah, she apologized for the others’ behaviors and wished me a good night.”\n“She apologized for the behavior of the thugs that attacked her?”\nAlfred nodded, puzzled, “I know, weird right?”\nButler sighed, “What happened next?”\nAnother shrug from Alfred, “I heard the police sirens at that point, the whole lot of them seemed to act as one and leave. The thugs, the girl, even the people watching from the club. Few seconds later, seemed like I was the only one there. Then the police showed up. You know the rest Detective.”\nDetective Butler leaned back in his chair and stared at Alfred, he couldn’t tell if the old man was just pulling his chain, crazy, or actually telling the truth.\n“Mr. White, first on scene does confirm that there was a car on its side in the intersection of 23rd and Capp Street, and that there was another car, a Black BMW, on fire a 100 feet or so away from the intersection…”\nAlfred nodded at Butlers words, “I told you I wasn’t good with cars.”\n“…But” Butler continued, “We talked to the owner of the club known as Belladonna’s and he said they were closed last night.”\nAlfred frowned, “That can’t be right, there were at least 10-15 people hanging outside the club watching.\nDetective Butler sighed and looked at the clock on the wall; it was now 4:15am, way past when he should be home in bed. He didn’t think Alfred was lying to him, but the story the old man told was just nuts. “Mr. White, is there anything you want to add or change maybe?”\nAlfred was still frowning down at the table, “Why would they say the club was closed?” he asked looking up at to meet Butler’s gaze.\n“I dunno,” Butler responded gathering his papers together and pulling one of his cards out of his pocket, “But if you think of anything else, please let me know.” He slid the card across the table and stood gesturing to the uniformed officer, “This officer will show you out.”\n“Yeah, yeah… you too, Detective.” Alfred said still a little distracted as he hauled himself to his feet.\nDetective Butler let out another long breath and walked back to his desk to write up a quick report before he headed home.\nAs Butler wrote up his report and fantasied about his bed, Alfred White walked the few short blocks from the precinct to his dark apartment amazed at the eventful night he’d had. He had unlocked his door and stepped inside before his old army senses kicked in and he realized he wasn’t alone in the apartment.\n“Hello?” Alfred called out softly as he closed the door behind him.\nA lamp in the living room clicked on, illuminating the young woman he had seen early that evening, “Hello Alfred.”\nAlfred took a couple steps forward into the living room, “It’s you… I was just talking about you with a Detective Butler.”\nThe woman smiled brilliantly, “All good things I hope?”\nAlfred couldn’t help but smile back, “Well to be honest miss it was mostly just weird, and I’m pretty sure he didn’t believe most of what I said.” Thinking back on what he’d seen, a look of puzzlement captured Alfred’s face, and he scratched his head, “Matter of fact, I don’t know if I would believe it either.”\nThe woman nodded with a sympathetic look on her face, “It is a lot to process for people.”\nA tingle started at the back of Alfred’s mind, “Miss, may I ask why you are here sitting in my living room? Are you here to kill me or something?”\nThe woman stood in one fluid motion and took a couple steps forward, “Of course not Alfred! But those memories you have from earlier might be viewed as dangerous by some. I’m just here to take that burden off your shoulders.”\nAlfred was still a little confused, but he’d just noticed the young woman’s eyes. They were an amazing violet, he didn’t think he’d ever seen anything quite like them, and they were so hypnotizing.\n“Ok…. But how are you gonna do that?” Alfred mumbled out. His mind was starting to get a little fuzzy with tiredness.\n“Don’t you worry about it,” the woman’s calming voice responded as she took Alfred’s arm and led him to his bedroom, “When you wake up, you’ll be well rested, and you won’t remember any of this.”\nAlfred tried to talk around the haze, “Are you gonna talk to Detective Butler as well? It would be nice if he knew I wasn’t telling tales.”\nAlfred’s eye’s closed before he even hit the bed, the last thing he heard before drifting off to sleep was the woman’s calming voice reassuring him.\nLucy quietly left Alfred’s apartment, locking the door behind her and giving a cheery ‘good morning!’ to the stunned woman just leaving for work across the hall. She donned her wide brimmed hat and sunglasses and walked down the three flights of stairs to the street and disappeared into the early morning bustle of commuters.\n","permalink":"/posts/7-lucy-short-story/","tags":["fiction","Sharpe_chronicles"],"title":"A short story for Lucy"},{"categories":null,"content":"Premise I had the idea a couple weeks ago to try and use a song, or music video as the inspiration for a creative writing bit. I went back and forth on what song to use, do I use one of the songs from my favorite band? Walk the Moon? or one of my more recent discoveries\u0026hellip; AJR? George Ezra?\nNope, I decided on Tones and I. You might know them by one of their hit singles, Dance Monkey from 2019. One of their more recent albums is called Welcome to the Madhouse from 2021. There are two songs, the title song \u0026lsquo;Welcome to the Madhouse\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Won\u0026rsquo;t Sleep\u0026rsquo; which I sort of confuzzled in my mind, lol. The song I was thinking of was \u0026lsquo;Welcome to the Madhouse\u0026rsquo; but \u0026lsquo;Won\u0026rsquo;t Sleep\u0026rsquo; has a music video that kept popping into my mind as well.\nThe YouTube links for both are linked below, feel free to give them a listen, then my very loose writing interpretation is below.\nInspiration Won\u0026rsquo;t Sleep video by Tones and I\nWelcome to the Madhouse by Tones and I\nYouTube Music link\rResults The Madhouse opportunity\nMichelle had been steadily growing her party planning business, Lumina Luxe Catering for almost two decades now, she\u0026rsquo;d started in Chicago right after the Urban wars had finally cooled down in 2032. It\u0026rsquo;d been a rough time to be party planner, but she had scrimped and saved. Working 14 hour days to cook, bartend, and serve every little gig that she could book. Slowly, she\u0026rsquo;d built up her reputation, working her way from doing small bar mitzvah\u0026rsquo;s and weddings in the local community centers to corporate retreats, then came the political charity fundraisers and c list celebrity parties.\nAfter climbing as far as she could in Chicago, she decided to move her main operation to New York City, again, putting her profits back into the company and expanding her capabilities. Now, with five years in the city that never sleeps, Michelle was the go to event planner for the most decerning of clients. she\u0026rsquo;d regularly put on single night events for 600+ people, flying in exotic chefs and entertainment from around the world. Vogue had even asked her to run the new Met Gala after it decided to restart in 2046.\nAnd yet, she\u0026rsquo;d been feeling restless for a little while now. she wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure what challenge to turn her sights on next. That\u0026rsquo;s when the letter had arrived from Mad House.\nDuring the early days of the urban wars, most secret societies had been targeted by the masses. The wealthy were seen as the new bourgeoise and had to therefore pay the prize for the anger that had been building for decades. The ivy league universities were also targeted, bombed and looted repeatedly, their very names and anyone or anything associated with them becoming almost untenable in main stream America. But when chaos reins, like it did during the urbans, people tended to band together for community. Many secret societies, clubs, and cults were born during those years, but few actually survived. Mad House was one of the few that survived, and actually thrived on the chaos.\nMad House was ostensibly a club, some might call it a secret society, but it was way too well known for that. The single overriding principle of the group was:\nLife is chaos, so seize the moment.\nMembership rosters were closely guarded, and by invitation only. They prided themselves on taking members from all walks of life, the only known stipulation being a open mind. It was rumored that they only had a few other membership requirements, but one thing was for sure, they were powerful and had their fingers everywhere. A reputable reporter had published a story a few years back on the top 10 celeb\u0026rsquo;s and politicians that were members. The next day the story had literally been wiped from the net and the reporter had issued a retraction and their resignation.\nIt was also rumored that they held a yearly extravagant ball that lasted multiple days, each year it had a different theme and was held in a different location.\nThe letter was on a crisp white piece of heavy paper. At the top was an embossed logo, a stylized letter \u0026ldquo;M\u0026rdquo; inside a shield with flames in in the background.\nMichelle slowly opened the letter and began to read, with each sentence she could feel her excitement raise another notch. This was the challenge she had been waiting for.\nMad House wanted her to plan next years ball. It was going to be right here in New York. The letter also contained a business card. On it, in neat print was only a contact number to contact with her answer. Further information would be provided once she\u0026rsquo;d signed the contract and NDA.\nShe didn\u0026rsquo;t need to think about it for very long, this was going to be the opportunity of a lifetime. she pulled out her communicator and input the contact number. The line connected and an automated voice told her to leave a message.\n\u0026ldquo;Hi, this is Michelle Yost, I am calling to say I accept the offer and am looking forward to getting to work soon.\u0026rdquo; nervously she disconnected the line and cleared her throat.\nHow long would she have to wait? she assumed they would have done all the necessary research into her before making the offer, but who knows how often they even checked that mailbox?\nShe was just starting to feel a little silly sitting there waiting in her office when her communicator beeped. A encrypted call from an unknown contact.\nNervously, she picked up the device and hit accept.\n\u0026hellip; to be continued\u0026hellip;\n","permalink":"/posts/6-story-from-a-song/","tags":["writing_prompt","fiction"],"title":"Story from a Song"},{"categories":null,"content":"Short post this week, I spent the first couple days this week battling a headache that just wouldn\u0026rsquo;t go away!\nNeedless to say, my creative drive was severely diminished.\nI decided to end my week with a little project to do a heat transfer vinyl design on a shirt with the Cricut Explorer 3 that my amazing wife got me for Christmas.\nI did a run to wally world to get a blank shirt (their plain t-shirt stock was surprisingly horrendous by the way\u0026hellip;definitely won\u0026rsquo;t be going there again any time soon!). Then I fired up the ol\u0026rsquo; Cricut design studio to figure out what I wanted. I had a basic idea from some inspiration I\u0026rsquo;ve seen around the interwebs, and the process was surprisingly painless.\nI loaded up the iron-on vinyl in the Cricut and told it to cut out my design! it immediately failed. lol\u0026hellip; It was asking for a mat that was 12\u0026quot; x 24\u0026quot; and I only had a 12\u0026quot; x 12\u0026quot;, so I shrunk the design a little and tried again. This time it didn\u0026rsquo;t complain and efficiently cut out my design\u0026hellip;and second failure, lol. I had put the vinyl on backwards, so it had scored the transfer tape, instead of cutting the vinyl. Ok, third times the charm, I flipped the vinyl sheet over and hit go again. Success!\nA quick cut and some light weeding (peeling off the little bits of vinyl that you don\u0026rsquo;t want around your design) later, I\u0026rsquo;m finally ready to iron on the design to the shirt. I positioned the design where I wanted it on the shirt, put some parchment paper over it to protect it. Then pressed down for 30-40 seconds with the iron set to cotton.\nAnd, presto! A new shirt created!\n!\rIf you don\u0026rsquo;t recognize the symbol, I don\u0026rsquo;t blame you\u0026hellip;much, lol. It\u0026rsquo;s from the classic Sci-Fi series StarGate SQ-1, it\u0026rsquo;s the chevron symbol for Earth. Or, home you might say.\nAll in all, the process was pretty quick and easy, I\u0026rsquo;m definitely curious to play around with it some more. We\u0026rsquo;ll see how the shirt does goes after some wear and wash cycles, but for the price and time, it was well worth it I think.\nHopefully next week I\u0026rsquo;ll get back to my regularly scheduled programming, a post that I\u0026rsquo;ve been actually wanting to do, creative writing based on listening to a song.\nUntil then, have a good week!\n","permalink":"/posts/5-no-place-like-sg1/","tags":["crafts"],"title":"There's no Place like home"},{"categories":null,"content":"The typical question you hear every January is \u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s your New Year resolution?\u0026rdquo; which is great and all, but it\u0026rsquo;s basis for self reflection is through the lens of necessary change. While self reflection is good, the optics of necessary change has the potential to be harmful.\nMy wife asked me a question the other day that seemed like a much more interesting angle on self reflection.\n\u0026ldquo;What did you learn from the past year?\u0026rdquo;\nWithout the burden of needing it to be about change for the new year, I think it gets to the benefit of self reflection much better.\nSo, how about it? what did you learn from 2024?\nMy obvious first quip was: Don\u0026rsquo;t underestimate the depths of the general publics desire to work against their own self interests \u0026hellip; electing a convicted felon who has flat out said he wants to get rid of democracy will definitely tamper your hope for humanity a little.\nBut after a little more thought I\u0026rsquo;ve come to two lessons learned from the past year.\n[!First] However much time you think a project will take, add at least 20%.\nI feel like multiple projects last year started with me thinking \u0026ldquo;oh yeah, I can definitely get that done in a weekend!\u0026rdquo; low and behold, some complication crops up that I had to work through, or the ground is made out of pure clay and I don\u0026rsquo;t have a teenage nephew at hand anymore for the hard digging, or I don\u0026rsquo;t have the right bit and have to run to the store to buy a new one.\nWhatever the case may be (not saying those happened or anything) give yourself time to work things out. You\u0026rsquo;ll also feel better about the project if you don\u0026rsquo;t feel rushed to finish it by a tight deadline. This has already come up in 2025 for me, giving myself a deadline for getting blog posts out weekly definitely is tighter than I probably should have gone.\n[!Second] ABL! Always be learning!\nOk, this one wasn\u0026rsquo;t something I specifically learned from 2024, and I\u0026rsquo;ve definitely been heard saying it long before then, but it felt more apt in 2024. I started multiple hobby\u0026rsquo;s/crafts, projects that pushed the bounds of my knowledge and I think I\u0026rsquo;m better for it. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t really matter what you learning (as long as it interests you or is useful!) but expanding your knowledge I think is always good.\nI started actual sewing projects trying to make my own clothes and gear, it definitely makes you see your wardrobe in a totally different light. I took classes on Python, a programming language, and it\u0026rsquo;s opened up new ideas for both work and personal processes that I could improve. Even small things, like adding a server to our home network gave me ideas for this blog or got me more comfortable with CLI (command line interface).\nSo whatever your own answer is, realize that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t necessitate change for the new year, but also don\u0026rsquo;t shy away from change. If you like where you\u0026rsquo;re at, great! keep doing that. If after some self reflection you see things that you want to change, also great! And if you do want to implement change, also remember it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to wait until the new year, go ahead and start learning that new skill or breaking that habit in July if you want!\nUntil next week!\n-Sam\n","permalink":"/posts/4-lessons-learned-from-2024/","tags":["writing_prompt"],"title":"New year, same problems"},{"categories":null,"content":"Short post this week due to the holiday\u0026rsquo;s.\nA few weeks ago I came across this YouTube video by Skill tree\nBoth Nine Men\u0026rsquo;s Morris and The Royal Game of Ur (RGU) looked really fun and simple to make. I also do have a bunch of scrap 2x2\u0026rsquo;s that would work great for RGU, and fortunately a bunch of black and white markers that I for some reason got from my dad years ago.\nAfter procrastinating the RGU project for weeks as other things got in the way (basement craft table, holiday lego night, actual holiday\u0026rsquo;s) I was doing some random exploring on Thingaverse\rand found found a model for RGU. Perfect! I have a 3D printer (the AnkerMake M5C), I\u0026rsquo;ll just print off a board, give it a little paint job and then I can test out the game before putting more time into a wooden version!\nThe board took about 2 hours to print and came out pretty good, although the edges need some clean up. ![[Pasted image 20241231105628.png| 300]]\nI printed out 4 of the tetrahedral dice as well, and took the lot out to the garage to sand and decide how I wanted to paint them. Unfortunately I only had a couple choices at the moment for paints, and as a V1 it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter a ton anyways. I figured denoting the starting location, and the extra move squares would probably be the best, and voila! I have a new board game to play with!\n![[Pasted image 20241231110704.png| 350]]\nI showed my newest creation to Sarah, and we ended up playing a round before dinner. It was a ton of fun and came down to the wire with her beating me at 7 to 6.\nIt was nice to test out the game without putting a lot of work into it, just to see if we liked it. I will definitely be building a V2, probably out of wood, and definitely with a better paint job. Although this set would definitely make a pretty good/light travel set if I made a little pouch to carry everything.\nStay tuned for V2 and see you next week!\n","permalink":"/posts/3-royal-game-of-ur/","tags":["board_games","3D_printing"],"title":"Making a new game"},{"categories":null,"content":"Dark shadows at the window Dark houses are silent.

I really did love the process of writing it, and the reaction of people reading it (those that did!). Since then, I\u0026rsquo;ve tried to work on the sequel, but I\u0026rsquo;ve had so much trouble with inspiration. It also was a completely different process for me the second time around.\nWith the first book, it came from a dream and the plot sort of grew naturally and morphed into the book that was published. With the second, I have a clear sense of where I want to go, and an outline that I want to follow. Maybe this is the issue? the way my creative brain works it\u0026rsquo;s much harder to fill in the gaps of the story then to just let it flow naturally.\nWhatever the reason, it\u0026rsquo;s now the end of 2024 and the second book only has about 25 pages actually written. This writers block has some serious strength to it!. I\u0026rsquo;ve repeatedly put it aside, hoping that inspiration will come only to pick it up months later and still be at a loss after a few words or sentences.\nAnother possibility is that I got involved with my amazing wife, Sarah, around the same time as I published book number one and started working on book number two. Having a partner has brought immense joy into my life, but definitely limits some of my time that I previously spent creatively writing, lol. Was creative writing something I did because I was lonely before?? Who knows!\nWhatever the reasons, I\u0026rsquo;ve been very frustrated by my writers block for awhile now and haven\u0026rsquo;t figured out a way around it. Recently I was watching a very interesting YouTube video by NetworkChuck Starting a blog in 2024\r. The idea of mixing two of my interests, the technical data automation side, and the creative writing aspect peaked my interest.\nAnd boy, has it been interesting so far! NetworkChuck\u0026rsquo;s walkthrough video and his own blog post helped a ton, but there was definitely some technical troubleshooting that I had to do myself to get everything working as it should (and more to come, as you might notice, the logo on the website still isn\u0026rsquo;t loading). I will say that I am really liking Obsidian.md as a note and writing tool.\nSo, finally, what is the objective of the blog?\nWell, I\u0026rsquo;m going to give my self the objective of posting at least once a week in 2025, that\u0026rsquo;s 52 posts. Hopefully the act of writing, about whatever I feel like that week, will help the creative spark flourish in my other writing projects as well. Some might be a little technical, some might be about other crafty projects I\u0026rsquo;m working on, some might be creative writing\u0026hellip;the point is just to get back into writing!\nUntil next week and wishing everyone a good end of the year!\n-Sam\n","permalink":"/posts/2-reason-for-the-blog/","tags":["blog","first_post"],"title":"Reason for the Blog"},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"/manifest.json","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"/search/_index.de/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"/search/_index.es/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"/search/_index.fr/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"/search/_index.hi/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"/search/_index.jp/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"/search/_index.nl/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"/search/_index.pl/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"/search/_index.ru/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"/search/_index.zh-cn/","tags":null,"title":""}]
