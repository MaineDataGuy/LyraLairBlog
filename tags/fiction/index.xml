      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;premise&#34;&gt;Premise&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You might remember from a couple weeks ago, my idea for a creative writing based on listening to a song &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.lyralair.com/posts/6-story-from-a-song/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Story from a Song &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;. Well, this was the second idea that popped into my brain because of that, so I thought I would flesh it out a little more and share it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let me know your thoughts!  &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:blogfeedback@sambw.me&#34;&gt;blogfeedback@sambw.me&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-wish&#34;&gt;The Wish&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There were stories in the small town about the old house on the hill. The house was just north of the town center, up a old dirt road that had long ago been abandoned by developers. No one lived there as far as town records were concerned, yet it stood. Every now and then a developer would come in, trying to buy up the valuable real estate it sat on, but they never succeeded. And so, the house endured, as it had since the town was founded. The townspeople tended to view the house and its land with a certain air of willful ignorance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Another starter for you, I would actually love comments on, feel free to send me some feedback! &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:writing@sambw.me&#34;&gt;writing@sambw.me&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;harper&#34;&gt;Harper&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Detective Strauss stepped through the hospital&amp;rsquo;s double front door and immediately wanted a smoke. There was just something about hospitals that got under his skin. He gritted his teeth and pushed the feeling down. He was a cop damnit and on duty. Getting his bearings, he made his way to the ER wing, where he found a very green and stiff uniform standing outside a curtained off area.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A short story for Lucy</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I thought I&amp;rsquo;d share some more creative writing this week. Below is the beginning of a short story I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on that takes place in the same world as my novel, The Sharpe Chronicles. It&amp;rsquo;s set before the novel takes place and centers around Lucy. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It had been a long night and detective Butler was tired, it was now 3:20am, twenty minutes past the end of his shift but unfortunately his Lieutenant had handed him an assignment as he was getting ready to head home. There had been some sort of incident involving a bar in the Mission district. Another detective had been assigned as primary, but the Lieutenant had told Butler to help with the witness interview process. Butler sighed as he heaved himself up from his desk and headed for the interview room.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Story from a Song</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;premise&#34;&gt;Premise&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I had the idea a couple weeks ago to try and use a song, or music video as the inspiration for a creative writing bit. I went back and forth on what song to use, do I use one of the songs from my favorite band? Walk the Moon? or one of my more recent discoveries&amp;hellip; AJR? George Ezra?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nope, I decided on Tones and I. You might know them by one of their hit singles, Dance Monkey from 2019. One of their more recent albums is called Welcome to the Madhouse from 2021. There are two songs, the title song &amp;lsquo;Welcome to the Madhouse&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Won&amp;rsquo;t Sleep&amp;rsquo; which I sort of confuzzled in my mind, lol. The song I was thinking of was &amp;lsquo;Welcome to the Madhouse&amp;rsquo; but &amp;lsquo;Won&amp;rsquo;t Sleep&amp;rsquo; has a music video that kept popping into my mind as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
