      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;premise&#34;&gt;Premise&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You might remember from a couple weeks ago, my idea for a creative writing based on listening to a song &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.lyralair.com/posts/6-story-from-a-song/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Story from a Song &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;. Well, this was the second idea that popped into my brain because of that, so I thought I would flesh it out a little more and share it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let me know your thoughts!  &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:blogfeedback@sambw.me&#34;&gt;blogfeedback@sambw.me&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-wish&#34;&gt;The Wish&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There were stories in the small town about the old house on the hill. The house was just north of the town center, up a old dirt road that had long ago been abandoned by developers. No one lived there as far as town records were concerned, yet it stood. Every now and then a developer would come in, trying to buy up the valuable real estate it sat on, but they never succeeded. And so, the house endured, as it had since the town was founded. The townspeople tended to view the house and its land with a certain air of willful ignorance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Hume’s Problem of Induction</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was recently going through documents on my computer and came across a paper I wrote for my Epistemology philosophy class in college. As I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a solid idea for a blog topic this week, and do really find the content interesting, I thought I would share. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;humes-problem-of-induction--an-essay&#34;&gt;Hume&amp;rsquo;s Problem of Induction- an essay&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The 17th century Polish alchemist Michael Sendivogius once said &amp;ldquo;Experience is the sole teacher of truth.&amp;rdquo; This is the essence of the scientific and Empiricist mind and in my view completely true. But what can experience tell us? In Hume’s &lt;em&gt;An Enquiry concerning Human understanding&lt;/em&gt; he relates his problem of induction and its consequences for Epistemology. This essay will show that rationalism is not the answer, lay out Hume’s argument and conclusions, and show that our grasp of knowledge is impossible for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Another starter for you, I would actually love comments on, feel free to send me some feedback! &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:writing@sambw.me&#34;&gt;writing@sambw.me&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;harper&#34;&gt;Harper&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Detective Strauss stepped through the hospital&amp;rsquo;s double front door and immediately wanted a smoke. There was just something about hospitals that got under his skin. He gritted his teeth and pushed the feeling down. He was a cop damnit and on duty. Getting his bearings, he made his way to the ER wing, where he found a very green and stiff uniform standing outside a curtained off area.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A short story for Lucy</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I thought I&amp;rsquo;d share some more creative writing this week. Below is the beginning of a short story I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on that takes place in the same world as my novel, The Sharpe Chronicles. It&amp;rsquo;s set before the novel takes place and centers around Lucy. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It had been a long night and detective Butler was tired, it was now 3:20am, twenty minutes past the end of his shift but unfortunately his Lieutenant had handed him an assignment as he was getting ready to head home. There had been some sort of incident involving a bar in the Mission district. Another detective had been assigned as primary, but the Lieutenant had told Butler to help with the witness interview process. Butler sighed as he heaved himself up from his desk and headed for the interview room.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;premise&#34;&gt;Premise&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I had the idea a couple weeks ago to try and use a song, or music video as the inspiration for a creative writing bit. I went back and forth on what song to use, do I use one of the songs from my favorite band? Walk the Moon? or one of my more recent discoveries&amp;hellip; AJR? George Ezra?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nope, I decided on Tones and I. You might know them by one of their hit singles, Dance Monkey from 2019. One of their more recent albums is called Welcome to the Madhouse from 2021. There are two songs, the title song &amp;lsquo;Welcome to the Madhouse&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Won&amp;rsquo;t Sleep&amp;rsquo; which I sort of confuzzled in my mind, lol. The song I was thinking of was &amp;lsquo;Welcome to the Madhouse&amp;rsquo; but &amp;lsquo;Won&amp;rsquo;t Sleep&amp;rsquo; has a music video that kept popping into my mind as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Short post this week, I spent the first couple days this week battling a headache that just wouldn&amp;rsquo;t go away!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, my creative drive was severely diminished.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I decided to end my week with a little project to do a heat transfer vinyl design on a shirt with the Cricut Explorer 3 that my amazing wife got me for Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I did a run to wally world to get a blank shirt (their plain t-shirt stock was surprisingly horrendous by the way&amp;hellip;definitely won&amp;rsquo;t be going there again any time soon!). Then I fired up the ol&amp;rsquo; Cricut design studio to figure out what I wanted. I had a basic idea from some inspiration I&amp;rsquo;ve seen around the interwebs, and the process was surprisingly painless.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The typical question you hear every January is &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s your New Year resolution?&amp;rdquo; which is great and all, but it&amp;rsquo;s basis for self reflection is through the lens of necessary change. While self reflection is good, the optics of necessary change has the potential to be harmful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My wife asked me a question the other day that seemed like a much more interesting angle on self reflection.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What did you learn from the past year?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Short post this week due to the holiday&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago I came across this YouTube video by Skill tree&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/lWBWs-EgALU?si=uXgOkZXvIKehGofV&#34; title=&#34;YouTube video player&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share&#34; referrerpolicy=&#34;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Both Nine Men&amp;rsquo;s Morris and The Royal Game of Ur (RGU) looked really fun and simple to make. I also do have a bunch of scrap 2x2&amp;rsquo;s that would work great for RGU, and fortunately a bunch of black and white markers that I for some reason got from my dad years ago.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Reason for the Blog</title>
      <link>/posts/2-reason-for-the-blog/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I self published my first book, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1520218400/ref=ox_sc_saved_image_9?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;amp;psc=1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;The Sharpe Chronicles: Alexander&amp;rsquo;s Genesis&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;, in December 2016. I really did love the process of writing it, and the reaction of people reading it (those that did!). Since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to work on the sequel, but I&amp;rsquo;ve had so much trouble with inspiration. It also was a completely different process for me the second time around.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With the first book, it came from a dream and the plot sort of grew naturally and morphed into the book that was published. With the second, I have a clear sense of where I want to go, and an outline that I want to follow. Maybe this is the issue? the way my creative brain works it&amp;rsquo;s much harder to fill in the gaps of the story then to just let it flow naturally.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
