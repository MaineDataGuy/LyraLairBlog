title: Men in the Night
Date: 2024-12-22
---
Dark shadows at the window
Dark houses are silent.
Dogs stop barking.
Wind stops blowing.
Figures keep coming.
Seconds take minutes
Minutes take hours
Hours take days.
Men in the night take people
Away… away,
To where they’ll never come back.
Men in the night keep coming.

*Poem that I wrote many years ago*
