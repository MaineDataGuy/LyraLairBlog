# Premise

I had the idea a couple weeks ago to try and use a song, or music video as the inspiration for a creative writing bit. I went back and forth on what song to use, do I use one of the songs from my favorite band? Walk the Moon? or one of my more recent discoveries... AJR? George Ezra?

Nope, I decided on Tones and I. You might know them by one of their hit singles, Dance Monkey from 2019. One of their more recent albums is called Welcome to the Madhouse from 2021. There are two songs, the title song 'Welcome to the Madhouse' and 'Won't Sleep' which I sort of confuzzled in my mind, lol. The song I was thinking of was 'Welcome to the Madhouse' but 'Won't Sleep' has a music video that kept popping into my mind as well.

The YouTube links for both are linked below, feel free to give them a listen, then my very loose writing interpretation is below.

## Results

<u>The Madhouse opportunity</u>

Michelle had been steadily growing her party planning business, *Lumina Luxe Catering* for almost two decades now, she'd started in Chicago right after the Urban wars had finally cooled down in 2032. It'd been a rough time to be party planner, but she had scrimped and saved. Working 14 hour days to cook, bartend, and serve every little gig that she could book. Slowly, she'd built up her reputation, working her way from doing small bar mitzvah's and weddings in the local community centers to corporate retreats, then came the political charity fundraisers and c list celebrity parties.

After climbing as far as she could in Chicago, she decided to move her main operation to New York City, again, putting her profits back into the company and expanding her capabilities. Now, with five years in the city that never sleeps, Michelle was the go to event planner for the most decerning of clients. she'd regularly put on single night events for 600+ people, flying in exotic chefs and entertainment from around the world. Vogue had even asked her to run the new Met Gala after it decided to restart in 2046.

And yet, she'd been feeling restless for a little while now. she wasn't sure what challenge to turn her sights on next. That's when the letter had arrived from Mad House.

During the early days of the urban wars, most secret societies had been targeted by the masses. The wealthy were seen as the new bourgeoise and had to therefore pay the prize for the anger that had been building for decades. The ivy league universities were also targeted, bombed and looted repeatedly, their very names and anyone or anything associated with them becoming almost untenable in main stream America. But when chaos reins, like it did during the urbans, people tended to band together for community. Many secret societies, clubs, and cults were born during those years, but few actually survived. Mad House was one of the few that survived, and actually thrived on the chaos.

Mad House was ostensibly a club, some might call it a secret society, but it was way too well known for that. The single overriding principle of the group was: 

 **Life is chaos, so seize the moment.**

Membership rosters were closely guarded, and by invitation only. They prided themselves on taking members from all walks of life, the only known stipulation being a open mind. It was rumored that they only had a few other membership requirements, but one thing was for sure, they were powerful and had their fingers everywhere. A reputable reporter had published a story a few years back on the top 10 celeb's and politicians that were members. The next day the story had literally been wiped from the net and the reporter had issued a retraction and their resignation.  

It was also rumored that they held a yearly extravagant ball that lasted multiple days, each year it had a different theme and was held in a different location.

The letter was on a crisp white piece of heavy paper. At the top was an embossed logo, a stylized letter "M" inside a shield with flames in in the background.

Michelle slowly opened the letter and began to read, with each sentence she could feel her excitement raise another notch. This was the challenge she had been waiting for.

Mad House wanted her to plan next years ball. It was going to be right here in New York. The letter also contained a business card. On it, in neat print was only a contact number to contact with her answer. Further information would be provided once she'd signed the contract and NDA.

She didn't need to think about it for very long, this was going to be the opportunity of a lifetime. she pulled out her communicator and input the contact number. The line connected and an automated voice told her to leave a message.

"Hi, this is Michelle Yost, I am calling to say I accept the offer and am looking forward to getting to work soon." nervously she disconnected the line and cleared her throat. 

How long would she have to wait? she assumed they would have done all the necessary research into her before making the offer, but who knows how often they even checked that mailbox?

She was just starting to feel a little silly sitting there waiting in her office when her communicator beeped. A encrypted call from an unknown contact.

Nervously, she picked up the device and hit accept.
