[{"categories":null,"content":"The typical question you hear every January is \u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s your New Year resolution?\u0026rdquo; which is great and all, but it\u0026rsquo;s basis for self reflection is through the lens of necessary change. While self reflection is good, the optics of necessary change has the potential to be harmful.\nMy wife asked me a question the other day that seemed like a much more interesting angle on self reflection.\n\u0026ldquo;What did you learn from the past year?\u0026rdquo;\nWithout the burden of needing it to be about change for the new year, I think it gets to the benefit of self reflection much better.\nSo, how about it? what did you learn from 2024?\nMy obvious first quip was: Don\u0026rsquo;t underestimate the depths of the general publics desire to work against their own self interests \u0026hellip; electing a convicted felon who has flat out said he wants to get rid of democracy will definitely tamper your hope for humanity a little.\nBut after a little more thought I\u0026rsquo;ve come to two lessons learned from the past year.\n[!First] However much time you think a project will take, add at least 20%.\nI feel like multiple projects last year started with me thinking \u0026ldquo;oh yeah, I can definitely get that done in a weekend!\u0026rdquo; low and behold, some complication crops up that I had to work through, or the ground is made out of pure clay and I don\u0026rsquo;t have a teenage nephew at hand anymore for the hard digging, or I don\u0026rsquo;t have the right bit and have to run to the store to buy a new one.\nWhatever the case may be (not saying those happened or anything) give yourself time to work things out. You\u0026rsquo;ll also feel better about the project if you don\u0026rsquo;t feel rushed to finish it by a tight deadline. This has already come up in 2025 for me, giving myself a deadline for getting blog posts out weekly definitely is tighter than I probably should have gone.\n[!Second] ABL! Always be learning!\nOk, this one wasn\u0026rsquo;t something I specifically learned from 2024, and I\u0026rsquo;ve definitely been heard saying it long before then, but it felt more apt in 2024. I started multiple hobby\u0026rsquo;s/crafts, projects that pushed the bounds of my knowledge and I think I\u0026rsquo;m better for it. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t really matter what you learning (as long as it interests you or is useful!) but expanding your knowledge I think is always good.\nI started actual sewing projects trying to make my own clothes and gear, it definitely makes you see your wardrobe in a totally different light. I took classes on Python, a programming language, and it\u0026rsquo;s opened up new ideas for both work and personal processes that I could improve. Even small things, like adding a server to our home network gave me ideas for this blog or got me more comfortable with CLI (command line interface).\nSo whatever your own answer is, realize that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t necessitate change for the new year, but also don\u0026rsquo;t shy away from change. If you like where you\u0026rsquo;re at, great! keep doing that. If after some self reflection you see things that you want to change, also great! And if you do want to implement change, also remember it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to wait until the new year, go ahead and start learning that new skill or breaking that habit in July if you want!\nUntil next week!\n-Sam\n","permalink":"/posts/4-lessons-learned-from-2024/","tags":["writing_prompt"],"title":"New year, same problems"},{"categories":null,"content":"Short post this week due to the holiday\u0026rsquo;s.\nA few weeks ago I came across this YouTube video by Skill tree\nBoth Nine Men\u0026rsquo;s Morris and The Royal Game of Ur (RGU) looked really fun and simple to make. I also do have a bunch of scrap 2x2\u0026rsquo;s that would work great for RGU, and fortunately a bunch of black and white markers that I for some reason got from my dad years ago.\nAfter procrastinating the RGU project for weeks as other things got in the way (basement craft table, holiday lego night, actual holiday\u0026rsquo;s) I was doing some random exploring on Thingaverse\rand found found a model for RGU. Perfect! I have a 3D printer (the AnkerMake M5C), I\u0026rsquo;ll just print off a board, give it a little paint job and then I can test out the game before putting more time into a wooden version!\nThe board took about 2 hours to print and came out pretty good, although the edges need some clean up. ![[Pasted image 20241231105628.png| 300]]\nI printed out 4 of the tetrahedral dice as well, and took the lot out to the garage to sand and decide how I wanted to paint them. Unfortunately I only had a couple choices at the moment for paints, and as a V1 it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter a ton anyways. I figured denoting the starting location, and the extra move squares would probably be the best, and voila! I have a new board game to play with!\n![[Pasted image 20241231110704.png| 350]]\nI showed my newest creation to Sarah, and we ended up playing a round before dinner. It was a ton of fun and came down to the wire with her beating me at 7 to 6.\nIt was nice to test out the game without putting a lot of work into it, just to see if we liked it. I will definitely be building a V2, probably out of wood, and definitely with a better paint job. Although this set would definitely make a pretty good/light travel set if I made a little pouch to carry everything.\nStay tuned for V2 and see you next week!\n","permalink":"/posts/3-royal-game-of-ur/","tags":["board_games","3D_printing"],"title":"Making a new game"},{"categories":null,"content":"Dark shadows at the window Dark houses are silent.

I really did love the process of writing it, and the reaction of people reading it (those that did!). Since then, I\u0026rsquo;ve tried to work on the sequel, but I\u0026rsquo;ve had so much trouble with inspiration. It also was a completely different process for me the second time around.\nWith the first book, it came from a dream and the plot sort of grew naturally and morphed into the book that was published. With the second, I have a clear sense of where I want to go, and an outline that I want to follow. Maybe this is the issue? the way my creative brain works it\u0026rsquo;s much harder to fill in the gaps of the story then to just let it flow naturally.\nWhatever the reason, it\u0026rsquo;s now the end of 2024 and the second book only has about 25 pages actually written. This writers block has some serious strength to it!. I\u0026rsquo;ve repeatedly put it aside, hoping that inspiration will come only to pick it up months later and still be at a loss after a few words or sentences.\nAnother possibility is that I got involved with my amazing wife, Sarah, around the same time as I published book number one and started working on book number two. Having a partner has brought immense joy into my life, but definitely limits some of my time that I previously spent creatively writing, lol. Was creative writing something I did because I was lonely before?? Who knows!\nWhatever the reasons, I\u0026rsquo;ve been very frustrated by my writers block for awhile now and haven\u0026rsquo;t figured out a way around it. Recently I was watching a very interesting YouTube video by NetworkChuck Starting a blog in 2024\r. The idea of mixing two of my interests, the technical data automation side, and the creative writing aspect peaked my interest.\nAnd boy, has it been interesting so far! NetworkChuck\u0026rsquo;s walkthrough video and his own blog post helped a ton, but there was definitely some technical troubleshooting that I had to do myself to get everything working as it should (and more to come, as you might notice, the logo on the website still isn\u0026rsquo;t loading). I will say that I am really liking Obsidian.md as a note and writing tool.\nSo, finally, what is the objective of the blog?\nWell, I\u0026rsquo;m going to give my self the objective of posting at least once a week in 2025, that\u0026rsquo;s 52 posts. Hopefully the act of writing, about whatever I feel like that week, will help the creative spark flourish in my other writing projects as well. Some might be a little technical, some might be about other crafty projects I\u0026rsquo;m working on, some might be creative writing\u0026hellip;the point is just to get back into writing!\nUntil next week and wishing everyone a good end of the year!\n-Sam\n","permalink":"/posts/2-reason-for-the-blog/","tags":["blog","first_post"],"title":"Reason for the Blog"},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"/manifest.json","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"/search/_index.de/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"/search/_index.es/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"/search/_index.fr/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"/search/_index.hi/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"/search/_index.jp/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"/search/_index.nl/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"/search/_index.pl/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"/search/_index.ru/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"/search/_index.zh-cn/","tags":null,"title":""}]
