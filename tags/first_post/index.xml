      <description>&lt;p&gt;I self published my first book, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1520218400/ref=ox_sc_saved_image_9?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;amp;psc=1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;The Sharpe Chronicles: Alexander&amp;rsquo;s Genesis&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;, in December 2016. I really did love the process of writing it, and the reaction of people reading it (those that did!). Since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to work on the sequel, but I&amp;rsquo;ve had so much trouble with inspiration. It also was a completely different process for me the second time around.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With the first book, it came from a dream and the plot sort of grew naturally and morphed into the book that was published. With the second, I have a clear sense of where I want to go, and an outline that I want to follow. Maybe this is the issue? the way my creative brain works it&amp;rsquo;s much harder to fill in the gaps of the story then to just let it flow naturally.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
