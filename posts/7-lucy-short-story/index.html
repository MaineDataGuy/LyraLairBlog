  content="I thought I&rsquo;d share some more creative writing this week. Below is the beginning of a short story I&rsquo;ve been working on that takes place in the same world as my novel, The Sharpe Chronicles. It&rsquo;s set before the novel takes place and centers around Lucy. Enjoy!
It had been a long night and detective Butler was tired, it was now 3:20am, twenty minutes past the end of his shift but unfortunately his Lieutenant had handed him an assignment as he was getting ready to head home. There had been some sort of incident involving a bar in the Mission district. Another detective had been assigned as primary, but the Lieutenant had told Butler to help with the witness interview process. Butler sighed as he heaved himself up from his desk and headed for the interview room.

        <p>I thought I&rsquo;d share some more creative writing this week. Below is the beginning of a short story I&rsquo;ve been working on that takes place in the same world as my novel, The Sharpe Chronicles. It&rsquo;s set before the novel takes place and centers around Lucy. Enjoy!</p>
<p>It had been a long night and detective Butler was tired, it was now 3:20am, twenty minutes past the end of his shift but unfortunately his Lieutenant had handed him an assignment as he was getting ready to head home. There had been some sort of incident involving a bar in the Mission district. Another detective had been assigned as primary, but the Lieutenant had told Butler to help with the witness interview process. Butler sighed as he heaved himself up from his desk and headed for the interview room.</p>
<p>Butler nodded at the uniformed officer and glanced down at the file in his hand as he walked into the room, “Good morning Mr. …. White, thanks for coming in so early to give your statement.” Butler looked up from his file and smiled at the grizzled old man.</p>
<p>“Just doing my civic duty; please, call me Alfred.” Alfred responded in a good-natured tone.</p>
<p>Butler relaxed a little; he had been expecting a rant on having to wait so long. “Ok Alfred, let’s start at the beginning- what did you see?”</p>
<p>“I’ve seen some weird stuff in my day but tonight&hellip;” Alfred fidgeted with the Styrofoam cup of bad station coffee that sat in front of him and frowned. Butler glanced at the officer standing at the door and got a shrug in response.</p>
<p>“Mr. White…I mean, Alfred&hellip;”</p>
<p>The old man interrupted by clearing his throat, “Detective, I joined the army the day I graduated high school. Didn’t do it for the rank like some of the other boys, or the glory the recruiter promised us.”</p>
<p>“That’s very noble of you Alfred.”</p>
<p>Alfred waved his hand in dismissal, “That wasn’t what I wanted either, just wanted to serve my country and maybe impress a few girls.” A ghost of a smile crossed his face as he continued to finger his coffee cup. “I’m telling you this, so you know that I’m not someone who likes to tell big stories.”</p>
<p>“Ok&hellip;.”</p>
<p>“I am 97 years old and have fought in three different wars: World War 2, Korea, and Vietnam. Let me tell you, I’ve seen some pretty strange things in my time.” Alfred continued with barely a pause. “I once saw a man who was 5 feet from a mortar blast get knocked back 20 feet then just get up and walk away.”</p>
<p>“Wow, that’s pretty amazing.” Butler said, just to keep the old man talking.</p>
<p>Alfred shook his head, “But tonight definitely takes the cake.”</p>
<p>“How so, Alfred?”</p>
<p>“It probably says in that file you have there, but I work the late shift at Luke’s pub as a line cook, it’s not the best hours but it’s an honest living. Every night for the past 20 years I’ve taken a walk around the neighborhood after my shift. Mind you, the neighborhood has changed a little, but not my route. I walk down 17th street to Mission and then walk all the way down to 23rd street before circling back on Van Ness Ave and walking home.”</p>
<p>Butler looked at his notes, “My notes say the incident was at 24th and Capp St. If you always turn at 23rd, how could you have seen anything?”</p>
<p>“Because, for the past month I’ve been walking down to 24th to avoid the club.”</p>
<p>“You mean the club going by the name Belladona?” Butler asked clarifying.</p>
<p>Alfred nodded, “Yeah…that one that took over the old church.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>Alfred shrugged one plaid covered shoulder, “I can’t give you an example or anything, but my gut just said it was some place to stay away from.”</p>
<p>“Ok, so last night you were walking down 24th Street near the Capp Street crossing…” Butler prompted, scribbling on a notepad.</p>
<p>Alfred bobbed his head, “Right… so I’m walking down the street, about to cross Capp and I hear shouts from down the block…towards 23rd. Then I hear a loud crash, like a car ran into something. I figured there was an accident, and I might be able to help so I headed up Capp.”</p>
<p>“What did you find?” Butler prompted after Alfred was quiet for a moment.</p>
<p>Alfred took a sip of water from the plastic cup sitting on the table in front of him, “I slowed as I got closer to the club. First thing I noticed was a car on fire in the street…”</p>
<p>Butler scribbled another note, “Can you describe the car?”</p>
<p>Alfred shrugged on shoulder, “I’m not too good with cars, but it was black or dark blue, and it was really nice. A Lexus maybe?”</p>
<p>Butler grunted in acknowledgement and waited for the old man to continue.</p>
<p>“People weren’t really paying attention to the car though, there were these folks near the door of the club that were looking further down Capp St., so I walked a little further down the other side of the street until I could get a good view.”</p>
<p>“What did you see?”</p>
<p>Alfred took another sip of water, “There were these five or six guys all circling around something in the middle of the intersection with 23rd street. They reminded me of a pack of hyenas. As they circled I was able to see between them to what they were focused on.” Alfred paused again, “Mind you, I don’t know what I was expecting, but it certainly wasn’t what I saw! Right in the middle of this group of thugs was this young girl just calm as you could be standing in the middle of the street. How do you like that? I don’t know if I’d be calm with thugs twice my size circling around me.”</p>
<p>Butler paused in his note taking and looked up, “A young girl?”</p>
<p>“Yeah! I was as surprised as you are! It took me a second for me to get over my shock.”</p>
<p>“Can you describe her?”</p>
<p>Alfred scratched his chin, “Well let’s see… she was wearing jeans and a pretty form fitting t-shirt if you know what I mean…and she couldn’t have been older than 26 or 27. I think she had brown hair? Yeah, longish brown hair that was up in a ponytail.”</p>
<p>Butler scribbled down Alfred’s description, “Ok, what happened next?”</p>
<p>“Well, when I finally got over the shock, I took a couple steps forward. Guess my brain wanted my body to help or somethin’…don’t know how helpful I could be at my age, but I was gonna try. They definitely weren’t there to help the poor girl.”</p>
<p>Butler looked over what he could see of Alfred White, besides a little sweat the old vet seemed perfectly fine, and didn’t seem to be injured or anything. “You seem to have done pretty well for yourself.”</p>
<p>Alfred let out a bark of laughter, “I wish! I had every intention of lending a hand and getting my butt whipped, but that young woman had it completely handled. The moment I stepped forward they rushed in to attack her and man could they fight!”</p>
<p>Butler frowned and was about to speak when Alfred continued, “Mind you, my eyes aren’t what they used to be, and I was never one for the hand-to-hand fighting, but from what I saw, any one of those guys could have easily gone round for round with any boxing champion…. And you know what?”</p>
<p>“What?” Butler responded, knowing his queue.</p>
<p>“Not a single one of them laid a pinky on that woman. It was a sight to behold.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean, she managed to get away?”</p>
<p>Alfred shook his head emphatically, “No! She didn’t even attempt to run away. I swear, they would go to punch her, and she just wouldn’t be there anymore. I don’t know how else to explain it, it was like watching a fight movie with frames missing. One second, they would be in one place, then BLAM! They would be standing 10 feet to their left like they’d never moved.”</p>
<p>Butler flicked a glance at the officer standing by the door, “You said your eyes aren’t what they used to be Alfred?”</p>
<p>Alfred sighed, “Look, I know what I’m telling you sounds out there, and my eyes definitely aren’t as sharp as they used to be. But I still have 20/20, never needed glasses a day in my life.”</p>
<p>Butler stared at Alfred for a second before nodding, “Ok, what happened next?”</p>
<p>“As I said, it was like watching a fight movie with frames missing… all of a sudden, the thugs started dropping like flies. I didn’t even see the girl throw a punch, but first one thug went flying back, then another slammed into the side of a car. Then a third and fourth went skidding down the street in the opposite direction. Then things got a little weird.”</p>
<p>“Then things got weird?” Butler asked incredulously.</p>
<p>Alfred nodded, “The thug that had been thrown against the side of the car? Well, he shouted something in a foreign language out of frustration, I think he called the girl Lucy and picked up the car and threw it at her.”</p>
<p>There was silence in the small interview room as Detective Butler processed what Alfred had said.</p>
<p>Finally, Butler spoke, “Did you say he picked up the car?”</p>
<p>Alfred nodded and mimed picking up a box on his right with two hands and throwing it to his left, “Yup, I almost didn’t believe it either, but since I was directly in the path of the car as it hit the ground and slid, I got a very good view.” Alfred paused to take another sip of water, “I probably would have been a goner if it hadn’t of been for that girl… I heard her sigh, then all of a sudden, she was right in front of me and the car had stopped and was sitting on its passenger side.”</p>
<p>“Uh huh…” Butler managed to say.</p>
<p>“I guess I made a sound or something because the girl turned around and looked at me with this blazing smile on her face.</p>
<p>“Did she say anything?”</p>
<p>Alfred smiled, “Yeah, she apologized for the others’ behaviors and wished me a good night.”</p>
<p>“She apologized for the behavior of the thugs that attacked her?”</p>
<p>Alfred nodded, puzzled, “I know, weird right?”</p>
<p>Butler sighed, “What happened next?”</p>
<p>Another shrug from Alfred, “I heard the police sirens at that point, the whole lot of them seemed to act as one and leave. The thugs, the girl, even the people watching from the club. Few seconds later, seemed like I was the only one there. Then the police showed up. You know the rest Detective.”</p>
<p>Detective Butler leaned back in his chair and stared at Alfred, he couldn’t tell if the old man was just pulling his chain, crazy, or actually telling the truth.</p>
<p>“Mr. White, first on scene does confirm that there was a car on its side in the intersection of 23rd and Capp Street, and that there was another car, a Black BMW, on fire a 100 feet or so away from the intersection…”</p>
<p>Alfred nodded at Butlers words, “I told you I wasn’t good with cars.”</p>
<p>“…But” Butler continued, “We talked to the owner of the club known as Belladonna’s and he said they were closed last night.”</p>
<p>Alfred frowned, “That can’t be right, there were at least 10-15 people hanging outside the club watching.</p>
<p>Detective Butler sighed and looked at the clock on the wall; it was now 4:15am, way past when he should be home in bed. He didn’t think Alfred was lying to him, but the story the old man told was just nuts.  “Mr. White, is there anything you want to add or change maybe?”</p>
<p>Alfred was still frowning down at the table, “Why would they say the club was closed?” he asked looking up at to meet Butler’s gaze.</p>
<p>“I dunno,” Butler responded gathering his papers together and pulling one of his cards out of his pocket, “But if you think of anything else, please let me know.” He slid the card across the table and stood gesturing to the uniformed officer, “This officer will show you out.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, yeah… you too, Detective.” Alfred said still a little distracted as he hauled himself to his feet.</p>
<p>Detective Butler let out another long breath and walked back to his desk to write up a quick report before he headed home.</p>
<p> As Butler wrote up his report and fantasied about his bed, Alfred White walked the few short blocks from the precinct to his dark apartment amazed at the eventful night he’d had. He had unlocked his door and stepped inside before his old army senses kicked in and he realized he wasn’t alone in the apartment.</p>
<p>“Hello?” Alfred called out softly as he closed the door behind him.</p>
<p>A lamp in the living room clicked on, illuminating the young woman he had seen early that evening, “Hello Alfred.”</p>
<p>Alfred took a couple steps forward into the living room, “It’s you… I was just talking about you with a Detective Butler.”</p>
<p>The woman smiled brilliantly, “All good things I hope?”</p>
<p>Alfred couldn’t help but smile back, “Well to be honest miss it was mostly just weird, and I’m pretty sure he didn’t believe most of what I said.” Thinking back on what he’d seen, a look of puzzlement captured Alfred’s face, and he scratched his head, “Matter of fact, I don’t know if I would believe it either.”</p>
<p>The woman nodded with a sympathetic look on her face, “It is a lot to process for people.”</p>
<p>A tingle started at the back of Alfred’s mind, “Miss, may I ask why you are here sitting in my living room? Are you here to kill me or something?”</p>
<p>The woman stood in one fluid motion and took a couple steps forward, “Of course not Alfred! But those memories you have from earlier might be viewed as dangerous by some. I’m just here to take that burden off your shoulders.”</p>
<p>Alfred was still a little confused, but he’d just noticed the young woman’s eyes. They were an amazing violet, he didn’t think he’d ever seen anything quite like them, and they were so hypnotizing.</p>
<p>“Ok…. But how are you gonna do that?” Alfred mumbled out. His mind was starting to get a little fuzzy with tiredness.</p>
<p>“Don’t you worry about it,” the woman’s calming voice responded as she took Alfred’s arm and led him to his bedroom, “When you wake up, you’ll be well rested, and you won’t remember any of this.”</p>
<p>Alfred tried to talk around the haze, “Are you gonna talk to Detective Butler as well? It would be nice if he knew I wasn’t telling tales.”</p>
<p>Alfred’s eye’s closed before he even hit the bed, the last thing he heard before drifting off to sleep was the woman’s calming voice reassuring him.</p>
<p>Lucy quietly left Alfred’s apartment, locking the door behind her and giving a cheery ‘good morning!’ to the stunned woman just leaving for work across the hall. She donned her wide brimmed hat and sunglasses and walked down the three flights of stairs to the street and disappeared into the early morning bustle of commuters.</p>
