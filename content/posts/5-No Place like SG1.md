Short post this week, I spent the first couple days this week battling a headache that just wouldn't go away!

Needless to say, my creative drive was severely diminished.

I decided to end my week with a little project to do a heat transfer vinyl design on a shirt with the Cricut Explorer 3 that my amazing wife got me for Christmas.

I did a run to wally world to get a blank shirt (their plain t-shirt stock was surprisingly horrendous by the way...definitely won't be going there again any time soon!). Then I fired up the ol' Cricut design studio to figure out what I wanted. I had a basic idea from some inspiration I've seen around the interwebs, and the process was surprisingly painless.

I loaded up the iron-on vinyl in the Cricut and told it to cut out my design! it immediately failed. lol... It was asking for a mat that was 12" x 24" and I only had a 12" x 12", so I shrunk the design a little and tried again. This time it didn't complain and efficiently cut out my design...and second failure, lol. I had put the vinyl on backwards, so it had scored the transfer tape, instead of cutting the vinyl. Ok, third times the charm, I flipped the vinyl sheet over and hit go again. Success!

A quick cut and some light weeding (peeling off the little bits of vinyl that you don't want around your design) later, I'm finally ready to iron on the design to the shirt.  I positioned the design where I wanted it on the shirt, put some parchment paper over it to protect it. Then pressed down for 30-40 seconds with the iron set to cotton.

And, presto! A new shirt created!

If you don't recognize the symbol, I don't blame you...much, lol. It's from the classic Sci-Fi series StarGate SQ-1, it's the chevron symbol for Earth. Or, home you might say.

All in all, the process was pretty quick and easy, I'm definitely curious to play around with it some more. We'll see how the shirt does goes after some wear and wash cycles, but for the price and time, it was well worth it I think.

Hopefully next week I'll get back to my regularly scheduled programming, a post that I've been actually wanting to do, creative writing based on listening to a song.

Until then, have a good week!
