        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>I was recently going through documents on my computer and came across a paper I wrote for my Epistemology philosophy class in college. As I didn&rsquo;t have a solid idea for a blog topic this week, and do really find the content interesting, I thought I would share. Enjoy!</p>
<h2 id="humes-problem-of-induction--an-essay">Hume&rsquo;s Problem of Induction- an essay</h2>
<p>The 17th century Polish alchemist Michael Sendivogius once said &ldquo;Experience is the sole teacher of truth.&rdquo; This is the essence of the scientific and Empiricist mind and in my view completely true. But what can experience tell us? In Hume’s <em>An Enquiry concerning Human understanding</em> he relates his problem of induction and its consequences for Epistemology. This essay will show that rationalism is not the answer, lay out Hume’s argument and conclusions, and show that our grasp of knowledge is impossible for the time being.</p>
<p>To start there are two basic paths you can take with Epistemology, either Rationalism or Empiricism. While Rationalism will keep you away from the Hume’s problem it contains its own flaws. Rationalism is the basic idea that you can discover useful information about the world through pure reasoning and logic. For example, Descartes was a rationalist, he reasoned that if he cleared his brain of all the things he had learned over the years and started at the beginning, “I Think, therefore I am,” then he could come to “certain” conclusions about the world around him.  The ontological argument for the existence of God is a good example of this. The basic argument is this:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>God is the most perfect being</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Existence is a perfection (meaning to exist is more perfect then not to)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, God exists</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This is a very basic version of the argument but it still works. While the above argument is logical, it is only true by definition. Nothing about the above argument has anything to do with the world around us, I could just as easily replace God with The Flying Spaghetti Monster and the argument would still make perfect logical sense.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The Flying Spaghetti Monster is the most perfect being</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Existence is a perfection (meaning to exist is more perfect then not to)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, The Flying Spaghetti Monster exists</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>And while this method does logically work, it fails in its very purpose to tell us something new or useful about the world around us and so is useless.</p>
<p>One of the other major tenants of Rationalism is the idea of innate ideas. Innate ideas are those ideas that are intrinsic in us, they don’t require experience. We are born with them already in us (or our mind); examples of these are mathematical truths (2+2=4), or the idea of God (that he exists, is good, and is all powerful), the concept of time, or other necessary metaphysical principles<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> As Hume points out in <em>An Enquiry</em> there are several pitfalls to this theory,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A blind man can form no notion of colors; a deaf man of sounds. Restore either of them that sense in which he is deficient; by opening this new inlet for his sensations, you also open an inlet for the ideas; and he finds no difficulty in conceiving these objects.”  (Hume 168)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hume’s point here is that if color or sound were innate ideas then a blind or deaf person would know it even without the sense, instead of being “blind” to it until they experience it.</p>
<p>Another example of this: Let’s say Sara has been locked in a colorless room all her life; she can have access to any black and white book she wants. She knows from reading everything to know about the color red, its wavelength, its place in the rainbow, what happens when mixing it with other colors, etc…now on her 21st birthday the door is opened and she is allowed to go outside for the first time, where she sees a fire truck, or an apple, or really anything colored. Is this a new experience for her? We all would logically say yes, that seeing the color for the first time is a new experience that she had no idea of before that. If there where innate ideas (and color was innate idea) then the experience of seeing red would not be new. </p>
<p>Another counterexample to innate ideas is that of God, if God was an innate idea then every person on earth for all time would have the idea of God, and everybody’s idea would be the same. This is not the case, most eastern societies didn’t even have the concept of God until around the 7th century, and the Americas were even later than that. If God was an innate idea when the European missionaries came over to the Americas they would have found fellow Christians instead of the “pagan heathens.”  We also wouldn’t have the vast pile of gods that were once believed in and now aren’t, there are literally thousands of dead gods. (Tremblay)</p>
<p>So because Rationalism doesn’t seem to cut it, the only other path available is Empiricism which is defined by the idea that we get all of our knowledge through experience which comes from sense data and the idea that you need evidence for your beliefs. This system seems to be more stable for beliefs because it requires reasons, and it’s not dependent on your other beliefs. With rationalism you can have a set of beliefs that is completely broken from reality but is still self-validating. Empiricism breaks that because it grounds beliefs with necessary justification in experience.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>At birth we are no more than <em>Tabula Rasa</em> (Latin for “blank slate,” first proposed by Aristotle but largely forgotten until the late 17th century when John Locke brought it back to the forefront of philosophy) and over time we build upon our knowledge through experiences we have every day, this explains why a deaf man cannot think of a sound, or a blind man cannot conceive of color, or why Sara doesn’t know red before she is 21; they have not experienced it. This is why every culture has different gods, they all had different experiences in their part of the world and so came to create the gods that would best suit their society and the natural phenomena around them. Empiricism answers the questions left by Rationalism and so must be the correct path but it almost certainly leads us toward Hume’s problem of Induction.</p>
<p>Before getting to the problem of Induction, we need to understand the foundation for it, and how it arises. In Hume’s view there are two types of information, there are Matters of Fact and Relations of Ideas. Matters of Fact are the ones based on experience; they are empirical and synthetic. All of Science lies here. The other type, Relations of Ideas, is a priori, analytic and necessary. This group includes logic and math. Hume thinks that all of our ideas can fit into one of these two groups. The problem he thinks is trying to get from one side, Relations of Ideas (reasoning), to the other, Matter of Fact (experience) how can we use reasoning and logic to explain the world around us? Hume says we can’t, it’s not possible and that fact leads us to a serious problem.</p>
<p>Hume thinks that all knowledge is like a inverted pyramid, with simple ideas coming from sense data at the bottom and complex ideas (combinations of other ideas, either simple or other complex ideas) building up from those. This is how Hume sees knowledge being based off of experience and takes care of the classic problem of the infinite regress.</p>
<p>An interesting counterexample to this that Hume himself brings up but doesn’t resolve is the missing shade of blue. He points out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“…Suppose, therefore, a person to have enjoyed his sight for thirty years, and to have become perfectly acquainted with the colours of all kinds except one particular shade of blue, for instance, which it never has been his fortune to meet with. Let all the different shades of that colour, except that single one, be placed before him, descending gradually from the deepest to the lightest; it is plain that he will perceive a blank…”  (Hume 169)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The argument goes like this: say you have a strip of different shades of blue, like they use for painting, ranging from very dark blue to almost white. Now, take one of the shades out of the range and make it so that you can’t tell it was there; then show it to someone who hasn’t seen it before, he will be able to tell that there is a shade missing from the line up. Hume’s point is that if colors are simple ideas from only one sense and the observer hasn’t ever experienced the missing shade, how can he know that a color is missing? If we say that the observer can fill in the missing shade by imagining the combination of the darker and lighter shades on either side of the missing one, this implies that the colors aren’t simple ideas but complex ones or he has innate idea of the missing shade of blue.</p>
<p>Hume continues a couple lines later with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“…though this instance is so singular, that it is scarcely worth our observing, and does not merit that for it alone we should alter our general maxim”  (Hume 169)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some might think this is interesting because it seems as though Hume is just trying to sweep this major flaw in his theory under the rug; and maybe the missing shade is more problematic then we thought. If it can apply to sight, what about the other four senses? It does seem that Hume recognizes this when he starts off the example, <em>“…particular shade of blue, for example…”</em> this seems to imply that his choice of color (verses a particular smell, or taste) is arbitrary and could have been something else. First off I don’t think that it can be applied to the other senses, although it might be just custom/habit but I can’t imagine thinking up a missing taste or sound like I can a missing shade of blue. Secondly, as in all things in life, there are outliers and one example of color is no reason to throw out the entire theory, especially when it can be solved.</p>
<p>I think the only way to resolve the missing shade of blue problem without invoking the notion of innate ideas is to say that colors are complex ideas, which fits with experience. TV’s for example use only three colors to come up with the full spectrum of color that we need to depict the world around us and art students use color wheels to combine colors to make new ones. One might argue that this still requires a basis of colors for mixing, but I think that the error here is in thinking of the colors as separate squares on a grid instead of a continuum like they are found in nature.</p>
<p>So on to the problem of Induction, we’ve seen that Relations of Ideas are necessary and have a very firm base but tell us nothing about the world around us, whereas Matters of Fact, while telling us something new about the world around us, are contingent at best and have a somewhat shaky base. If we say that knowledge is based on Matters of Fact, then it’s grounded in experience. But Hume wants to know how direct experience of one object can tell us anything about similar objects or future objects.  It also seems like humans have a tendency to connect events by causality. Things must be either a cause or an effect, and this is how we experience the world around us, so we know Knowledge is grounded in experience but it seems like experience relies on causality, but causality relies on experience. How do we connect events that happen in the past to events that might happen in the future? Why do we connect the sound of thunder with the sight of lightning enough to say that during the next thunderstorm with lightning there will be thunder? We know from experience that things can go differently from what we expect yet we still base our actions/decisions off of those predictions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I have found that such an object has always been attended with such an effect, and I foresee, that other objects, which are, in appearance, similar, will be attended with similar effects.” (Hume 174)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The above statement is the general case; Hume’s point is what logical step do we take to get from the premise to the conclusion? This is the heart of Hume’s problem of Induction; how do we make the leap from direct experience to predicting the future or any other event that we haven’t experienced? Hume points out that there is no solid logical train from one to the other that he can think of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The connexion between these propositions is not intuitive. There is required a medium, which may enable the mind to draw such an inference, if indeed it be drawn by reasoning and argument. What that medium is, I must confess, passes my comprehension.”  (Hume 174)</p>
</blockquote>
<p> Since we can’t make a leap based on firm logic, how can we then have any knowledge about the world around us? We can’t Hume says but don’t let that stop you:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“And though none but a fool or madman will ever pretend to dispute the authority of experience, or to reject that great guide of human life, it may surely be allowed a philosopher to have so much curiosity at least as to examine the principle of human nature, which gives this mighty authority to experience, and makes us draw advantage from that similarity which nature has placed among different objects”  (Hume 175)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hume’s ultimate conclusion from the problem of Induction is that while we have a serious problem with causality and knowledge in general we would be idiots to ignore experience. This leads him to think that we do the things we do and believe what we believe not because it’s logically justified but because of custom and habit, we do it and accept it because that’s what we’ve done for thousands of years. He also thinks this applies to our belief in an external, independent world.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“all belief of matter of fact or real existence is derived merely from some object, present to the memory or senses, and a customary conjunction between that and some other object…if flame or snow be presented anew to the senses, the mind is carried by custom to expect heat or cold, and believe that such a quality does exist, and will discover itself upon a nearer approach. This belief is the necessary result of placing the mind in such circumstances” (Hume 178)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While I acknowledge that the problem of induction is serious, I can’t follow Hume to his full conclusion. Yes, we do things because of custom and habit and that probably applies to how we perceive the world around us, but the belief that there is an external world is logical simply because of the fact that we have experiences, and that those experience are similar to everyone else’s experiences<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. I can only follow Hume to the notion that we can’t be certain about any empirical knowledge; I can’t follow him to there being no external world because that would seem to imply that knowledge is never going to be possible no matter what.</p>
<p>Through all of this we have seen how difficult epistemology really is, you not only have to deal with metaphysics but also with philosophy of language, mind, and sometimes science. I think that Hume’s conclusion makes a good point; we would all be daft not to except how much experience and science have helped us throughout history.</p>
<p>As we’ve seen Rationalism doesn’t work, but if we take the Empiricist road then we run into Hume’s problem of induction and have trouble finding a basis for knowledge; but while he is content to except the problem of induction and move on I am more of a wait and see kind of person.</p>
<p> Throughout history there have been great questions raised with no answers provided, this does not mean that there is no answer and we should abandon the question, it simply implies that we have yet to understand enough of the world around us to answer the question. So as with many other hard questions this is one that just requires some more time until we have a grasp of the universe around us. I think in this instance the only logical solution is to fall back on Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle, you can never be certain about anything; especially not about the things you know.</p>
<p> How many times during our history have we made a new theory only to have it disproved later? Many times; this fact alone shows how little true knowledge we really have. We have only to look at the scientific world to find evidence of this, quantum entanglement, dark matter, the conveyance of gravity, and the origin of the universe; these are all subjects that are just mysteries now but in time will be solved and laid to the side with the other questions: is the earth flat? How many planets are there? Are we the center of the solar system?  So the solution to Hume’s problem of induction is not to dismiss it outright or see it as a impossible and turn away, no, the answer is to accept that right now true knowledge is impossible and only when we have a firm grasp of the universe and world around us can we try to say anything concrete about what we know. This is a formidable task and we might never achieve it; we might be in a race where the finish line keeps moving, but hopefully that’s not the case, hopefully the finish line is just static and just out of our current reach.</p>

<p>It seems that whenever rationalists need to explain some principle which is otherwise groundless it becomes an innate idea; God is a great example of this.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>One of the problems with strict empiricism is how thought derives from experience but also gives us methods of organizing it. While it is a problem it is not the subject of this paper and so I shall move on only saying that Kant addresses this in his <em>Critique of Pure Reason.</em>&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>This is based on the fact that we all seem to agree about the world around us in general, there are cases of people who see the world differently (mostly they are called crazy) but the majority agrees on the world around us.&#160;<a href="#fnref:3" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
