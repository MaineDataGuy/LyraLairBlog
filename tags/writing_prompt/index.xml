      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;premise&#34;&gt;Premise&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You might remember from a couple weeks ago, my idea for a creative writing based on listening to a song &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.lyralair.com/posts/6-story-from-a-song/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Story from a Song &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;. Well, this was the second idea that popped into my brain because of that, so I thought I would flesh it out a little more and share it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let me know your thoughts!  &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:blogfeedback@sambw.me&#34;&gt;blogfeedback@sambw.me&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-wish&#34;&gt;The Wish&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There were stories in the small town about the old house on the hill. The house was just north of the town center, up a old dirt road that had long ago been abandoned by developers. No one lived there as far as town records were concerned, yet it stood. Every now and then a developer would come in, trying to buy up the valuable real estate it sat on, but they never succeeded. And so, the house endured, as it had since the town was founded. The townspeople tended to view the house and its land with a certain air of willful ignorance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;premise&#34;&gt;Premise&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I had the idea a couple weeks ago to try and use a song, or music video as the inspiration for a creative writing bit. I went back and forth on what song to use, do I use one of the songs from my favorite band? Walk the Moon? or one of my more recent discoveries&amp;hellip; AJR? George Ezra?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nope, I decided on Tones and I. You might know them by one of their hit singles, Dance Monkey from 2019. One of their more recent albums is called Welcome to the Madhouse from 2021. There are two songs, the title song &amp;lsquo;Welcome to the Madhouse&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Won&amp;rsquo;t Sleep&amp;rsquo; which I sort of confuzzled in my mind, lol. The song I was thinking of was &amp;lsquo;Welcome to the Madhouse&amp;rsquo; but &amp;lsquo;Won&amp;rsquo;t Sleep&amp;rsquo; has a music video that kept popping into my mind as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The typical question you hear every January is &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s your New Year resolution?&amp;rdquo; which is great and all, but it&amp;rsquo;s basis for self reflection is through the lens of necessary change. While self reflection is good, the optics of necessary change has the potential to be harmful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My wife asked me a question the other day that seemed like a much more interesting angle on self reflection.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What did you learn from the past year?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
