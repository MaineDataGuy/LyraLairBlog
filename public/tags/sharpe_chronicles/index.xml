      <description>&lt;p&gt;I thought I&amp;rsquo;d share some more creative writing this week. Below is the beginning of a short story I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on that takes place in the same world as my novel, The Sharpe Chronicles. It&amp;rsquo;s set before the novel takes place and centers around Lucy. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It had been a long night and detective Butler was tired, it was now 3:20am, twenty minutes past the end of his shift but unfortunately his Lieutenant had handed him an assignment as he was getting ready to head home. There had been some sort of incident involving a bar in the Mission district. Another detective had been assigned as primary, but the Lieutenant had told Butler to help with the witness interview process. Butler sighed as he heaved himself up from his desk and headed for the interview room.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
