      <description>&lt;p&gt;The typical question you hear every January is &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s your New Year resolution?&amp;rdquo; which is great and all, but it&amp;rsquo;s basis for self reflection is through the lens of necessary change. While self reflection is good, the optics of necessary change has the potential to be harmful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My wife asked me a question the other day that seemed like a much more interesting angle on self reflection.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What did you learn from the past year?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Short post this week due to the holiday&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago I came across this YouTube video by Skill tree&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/lWBWs-EgALU?si=uXgOkZXvIKehGofV&#34; title=&#34;YouTube video player&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share&#34; referrerpolicy=&#34;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Both Nine Men&amp;rsquo;s Morris and The Royal Game of Ur (RGU) looked really fun and simple to make. I also do have a bunch of scrap 2x2&amp;rsquo;s that would work great for RGU, and fortunately a bunch of black and white markers that I for some reason got from my dad years ago.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dark shadows at the window&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;Dark houses are silent.&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;Dogs stop barking.&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;Wind stops blowing.&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;Figures keep coming.&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;Seconds take minutes&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;Minutes take hours&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;Hours take days.&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;Men in the night take people&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;Away… away,&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;To where they’ll never come back.&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;Men in the night keep coming.&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;Poem that I wrote many years ago&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Reason for the Blog</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I self published my first book, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1520218400/ref=ox_sc_saved_image_9?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;amp;psc=1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;The Sharpe Chronicles: Alexander&amp;rsquo;s Genesis&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;, in December 2016. I really did love the process of writing it, and the reaction of people reading it (those that did!). Since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to work on the sequel, but I&amp;rsquo;ve had so much trouble with inspiration. It also was a completely different process for me the second time around.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With the first book, it came from a dream and the plot sort of grew naturally and morphed into the book that was published. With the second, I have a clear sense of where I want to go, and an outline that I want to follow. Maybe this is the issue? the way my creative brain works it&amp;rsquo;s much harder to fill in the gaps of the story then to just let it flow naturally.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
