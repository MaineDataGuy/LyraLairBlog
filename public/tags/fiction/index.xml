      <description>&lt;p&gt;Another starter for you, this would I would actually love comments on, feel free to send me some feedback! &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:writing@sambw.me&#34;&gt;writing@sambw.me&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;harper&#34;&gt;Harper&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Detective Strauss stepped through the hospital&amp;rsquo;s double front door and immediately wanted a smoke. There was just something about hospitals that got under his skin. He gritted his teeth and pushed the feeling down. He was a cop damnit and on duty. Getting his bearings, he made his way to the ER wing, where he found a very green and stiff uniform standing outside a curtained off area.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I thought I&amp;rsquo;d share some more creative writing this week. Below is the beginning of a short story I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on that takes place in the same world as my novel, The Sharpe Chronicles. It&amp;rsquo;s set before the novel takes place and centers around Lucy. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It had been a long night and detective Butler was tired, it was now 3:20am, twenty minutes past the end of his shift but unfortunately his Lieutenant had handed him an assignment as he was getting ready to head home. There had been some sort of incident involving a bar in the Mission district. Another detective had been assigned as primary, but the Lieutenant had told Butler to help with the witness interview process. Butler sighed as he heaved himself up from his desk and headed for the interview room.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;premise&#34;&gt;Premise&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I had the idea a couple weeks ago to try and use a song, or music video as the inspiration for a creative writing bit. I went back and forth on what song to use, do I use one of the songs from my favorite band? Walk the Moon? or one of my more recent discoveries&amp;hellip; AJR? George Ezra?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nope, I decided on Tones and I. You might know them by one of their hit singles, Dance Monkey from 2019. One of their more recent albums is called Welcome to the Madhouse from 2021. There are two songs, the title song &amp;lsquo;Welcome to the Madhouse&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Won&amp;rsquo;t Sleep&amp;rsquo; which I sort of confuzzled in my mind, lol. The song I was thinking of was &amp;lsquo;Welcome to the Madhouse&amp;rsquo; but &amp;lsquo;Won&amp;rsquo;t Sleep&amp;rsquo; has a music video that kept popping into my mind as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
