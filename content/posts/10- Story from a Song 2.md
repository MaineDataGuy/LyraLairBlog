### Premise

You might remember from a couple weeks ago, my idea for a creative writing based on listening to a song [Story from a Song ](https://blog.lyralair.com/posts/6-story-from-a-song/). Well, this was the second idea that popped into my brain because of that, so I thought I would flesh it out a little more and share it.

Let me know your thoughts!  blogfeedback@sambw.me
### The Wish

There were stories in the small town about the old house on the hill. The house was just north of the town center, up a old dirt road that had long ago been abandoned by developers. No one lived there as far as town records were concerned, yet it stood. Every now and then a developer would come in, trying to buy up the valuable real estate it sat on, but they never succeeded. And so, the house endured, as it had since the town was founded. The townspeople tended to view the house and its land with a certain air of willful ignorance.

The stories themselves were passed down from one generation to the next, whispered on the school playground while eyeing the dirt trail that wound up the hill. Some said it belonged to one of the original Salem Witches, who still lived there to this day. Others said it was haunted by school children that died from a smallpox outbreak in 1753. New kids just hearing the stories would run home to ask their parent if it was true, who would laugh it off, but in the next breath forbid their child from exploring and keep a wary eye on the hill the rest of the day.

Highschoolers would try and prove their bravery by seeing who would try and get closest to the house. Those that made it to the front porch became legends amongst their peers.

Every now and then you heard other stories. Darker stories. People would whisper that for those brave or desperate enough to go inside, their wish might be granted, if the price paid was high enough. Jilted lovers asking for revenge, only to never find a happy relationship again. Parents asking for their sick child to be healed, only to get in a serious car accident several months later.    

Ally was one of these desperate people. She’d grown up hearing the stories of the house on the hill, she’d even been in a group in high school that had tried to throw a campfire party on the front lawn of the house. It hadn’t gone well. For all the effort they had put into planning the party, they hadn’t been able to get a single piece of kindle to catch fire. Plus, all three of the kegs that they had scored had broken in different ways. One had the tap get stuck, another keg had actually sprung a leak somehow, becoming an unintentional rocket and smashing through Billy’s car window, and the third had somehow been full of rancid beer.

She stood in front of the house now, remembering that night decades ago, it was darker now than it was then, no moonlight filtered through the leaves like it had for their party. They’d lasted maybe 30min before the entire party had gotten spooked and moved their shenanigans to somewhere a little safer. She remembered the feeling she’d gotten as they packed up the cars, like someone was watching them from the darkness of the house.

She could feel that now as well, although the house stood silent and empty, there was something there, watching to see what she did. A gust of wind blew across the small clearing, stirring up the fall leaves around her feet and almost pushing her towards the porch, and the front door that hung slightly ajar.

Ally took a deep breath, slowly letting it out as she walked up the weathered front steps. She hadn’t really looked at the house all those years ago when she was here, but now it seemed like she saw every little detail. It was small, barely large enough to be called a shed by today’s standards, but solid, nonetheless. It was made from roughhewn timbers, coated in some sort of protective tar, which just added to the gloom that seemed to cloak the primitive structure. A gust of wind followed her into the house, making the shutters and doors creak, and what sounded like whispers echo around the dark interior.

Ally turned on the flashlight from her phone, shining it around the small room. On one side there was an ancient stone fireplace, the stones blackened by soot. A large post stood in the center of the room, holding up the beam that carried the loft above. Carved into the post were dozens of names. Previous desperate souls that had come to have their dark wish fulfilled.

She circled the post, looking at everyone that had come before. Her fingers itched to run over the carvings, but something deep inside her told her not to. Finally, she found a relatively blank spot and took a small knife from her pocket, smoothly flipping it open.

The whispers in the house increased, as if multiple people were all trying to talk over each other. Suddenly it stopped and Ally could feel a question pushing against her, almost as if it was a physical force, “What is your wish child?”

Her breath caught on the lump in her throat as she thought of the reason she was there; this was the only way she could save him. Her sweet Josef needed her. Josef was her younger brother; he’d been a bright ball of sunshine when he was young. Bringing a smile to everyone around him. But then, at only 11 years old, he’d been diagnosed with stage 4 leukemia. It had been heartbreaking to slowly watch the life drain out of him over the last year, now he was a mere shadow of the bright boy he had been before. As he had deteriorated, so had the rest of the family. Their house had become almost as gloomy as this house on the hill.

Ally took a deep breath, she knew the risks, but she would give anything to see her family together and well again.

“I want Josef to get better.” She whispered into the still room. The words hung in the air, as if waiting for the presence to determine whether to grant her wish or not.

Again, a breeze blew through the room, bringing the whispers with it, “Very well, carve your name and your wish is granted…”

With trembling fingers, Ally carved her name into the bare spot on the post, each letter bringing an almost electric pulse of energy flowing from the post into her body. As she carved the final letter, she could feel an ache develop deep in her chest.  

She let out a breath that she didn’t know she’d been holding. She knew without a shadow of a doubt that her wish had come true. On a sob, she murmured thank you to the spirits and quickly left.

Ally started to see changes the very next day, Josef's doctor decided to order some more tests for Josef, to check his progress. The results were astonishing, the leukemia had gone into remission. The scans of bones showed significant improvement. Within a week, his bone pain was gone, and he’d stopped losing weight, within two, he had gained weight and was smiling again. His doctors were flabbergasted.

Just under two months later, the doctors had determined Josef was well enough to leave the hospital and come home. Their parents were going to bring Josef home today, while Ally had stayed home to decorate for the surprise home coming party.

Ally was ecstatic. Although she still felt the ache deep in her chest, a gentle reminder of the deal that she had made, she’d learned to ignore it most of the time. She’d blown up the balloons and hung streamers all over the house. People had started to arrive, generously bringing food to share with the community gathered. Her parents and the guest of honor were running late, but Ally wasn’t worried. They probably got hung up filling out hospital paperwork.

She was in a conversation with a friendly neighbor when the ache in her chest suddenly started pulsing like the beat of a drum, getting faster and faster, it made Ally catch her breath and put a hand to her chest.

“Ally, what’s wrong dear?”

Ally couldn’t answer, just as suddenly as it had started, it stopped… even the ache that she had grown accustomed to stopped. All she had now was a void where the ache used to be, a piece of her was gone. There was buzzing in her ears as she tried to understand what was happening. People around her were noticing and motioning her to sit down.

Someone knelt in front of her, urging her to take a glass of water they held. Ally tried to focus on them, to hear what they were saying.

“….just breath, there you go now, deep breaths…” It was Billy, her high school friend that had become a police officer.

But…he hadn’t been invited…

“Billy…what are you doing here?...” Ally managed to get out.

His eyes darkened, as his gaze flicked to the crowd around them before meeting hers again, “Ally…there was an accident on Route 55…Your parents car went off the road…I’m so sorry, no one made it out.”

The buzzing in her ears turned to a deafening roar as what Billy said sunk in.

As Ally sat amidst the wreckage of the party, she realized that the true cost of her wish was far greater than she could have ever imagined. The house on the hill had granted her desire, but it had also taken away the very essence of her happiness, leaving her alone to ponder the price of desperation.
