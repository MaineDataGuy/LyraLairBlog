      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was recently going through documents on my computer and came across a paper I wrote for my Epistemology philosophy class in college. As I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a solid idea for a blog topic this week, and do really find the content interesting, I thought I would share. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;humes-problem-of-induction--an-essay&#34;&gt;Hume&amp;rsquo;s Problem of Induction- an essay&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The 17th century Polish alchemist Michael Sendivogius once said &amp;ldquo;Experience is the sole teacher of truth.&amp;rdquo; This is the essence of the scientific and Empiricist mind and in my view completely true. But what can experience tell us? In Hume’s &lt;em&gt;An Enquiry concerning Human understanding&lt;/em&gt; he relates his problem of induction and its consequences for Epistemology. This essay will show that rationalism is not the answer, lay out Hume’s argument and conclusions, and show that our grasp of knowledge is impossible for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dark shadows at the window&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;Dark houses are silent.&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;Dogs stop barking.&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;Wind stops blowing.&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;Figures keep coming.&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;Seconds take minutes&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;Minutes take hours&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;Hours take days.&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;Men in the night take people&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;Away… away,&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;To where they’ll never come back.&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;Men in the night keep coming.&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;Poem that I wrote many years ago&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Reason for the Blog</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I self published my first book, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1520218400/ref=ox_sc_saved_image_9?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;amp;psc=1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;The Sharpe Chronicles: Alexander&amp;rsquo;s Genesis&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;, in December 2016. I really did love the process of writing it, and the reaction of people reading it (those that did!). Since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to work on the sequel, but I&amp;rsquo;ve had so much trouble with inspiration. It also was a completely different process for me the second time around.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With the first book, it came from a dream and the plot sort of grew naturally and morphed into the book that was published. With the second, I have a clear sense of where I want to go, and an outline that I want to follow. Maybe this is the issue? the way my creative brain works it&amp;rsquo;s much harder to fill in the gaps of the story then to just let it flow naturally.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
