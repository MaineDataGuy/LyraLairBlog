I self published my first book, [The Sharpe Chronicles: Alexander's Genesis](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1520218400/ref=ox_sc_saved_image_9?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&psc=1), in December 2016. I really did love the process of writing it, and the reaction of people reading it (those that did!). Since then, I've tried to work on the sequel, but I've had so much trouble with inspiration. It also was a completely different process for me the second time around. 

With the first book, it came from a dream and the plot sort of grew naturally and morphed into the book that was published. With the second, I have a clear sense of where I want to go, and an outline that I want to follow. Maybe this is the issue? the way my creative brain works it's much harder to fill in the gaps of the story then to just let it flow naturally.

Whatever the reason, it's now the end of 2024 and the second book only has about 25 pages actually written. This writers block has some serious strength to it!. I've repeatedly put it aside, hoping that inspiration will come only to pick it up months later and still be at a loss after a few words or sentences.

Another possibility is that I got involved with my amazing wife, Sarah, around the same time as I published book number one and started working on book number two. Having a partner has brought immense joy into my life, but definitely limits some of my time that I previously spent creatively writing, lol. Was creative writing something I did because I was lonely before?? Who knows!

Whatever the reasons, I've been very frustrated by my writers block for awhile now and haven't figured out a way around it. Recently I was watching a very interesting YouTube video by NetworkChuck [Starting a blog in 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnE7c0ELEH8). The idea of mixing two of my interests, the technical data automation side, and the creative writing aspect peaked my interest.

And boy, has it been interesting so far! NetworkChuck's walkthrough video and his own blog post helped a ton, but there was definitely some technical troubleshooting that I had to do myself to get everything working as it should (and more to come, as you might notice, the logo on the website still isn't loading). I will say that I am really liking Obsidian.md as a note and writing tool.

**So, finally, what is the objective of the blog?**

Well, I'm going to give my self the objective of posting at least once a week in 2025, that's 52 posts. Hopefully the act of writing, about whatever I feel like that week, will help the creative spark flourish in my other writing projects as well. Some might be a little technical, some might be about other crafty projects I'm working on, some might be creative writing...the point is just to get back into writing!

Until next week and wishing everyone a good end of the year!
