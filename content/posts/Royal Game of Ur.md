Short post this week due to the holiday's.

A few weeks ago I came across this YouTube video by Skill tree

Both Nine Men's Morris and The Royal Game of Ur (RGU) looked really fun and simple to make. I also do have a bunch of scrap 2x2's that would work great for RGU, and fortunately a bunch of black and white markers that I for some reason got from my dad years ago.

After procrastinating the RGU project for weeks as other things got in the way (basement craft table, holiday lego night, actual holiday's) I was doing some random exploring on [Thingaverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2823072) and found found a model for RGU. Perfect! I have a 3D printer (the AnkerMake M5C), I'll just print off a board, give it a little paint job and then I can test out the game before putting more time into a wooden version!

The board took about 2 hours to print and came out pretty good, although the edges need some clean up

I printed out 4 of the tetrahedral dice as well, and took the lot out to the garage to sand and decide how I wanted to paint them. Unfortunately I only had a couple choices at the moment for paints, and as a V1 it doesn't matter a ton anyways. I figured denoting the starting location, and the extra move squares would probably be the best, and voila! I have a new board game to play with!

I showed my newest creation to Sarah, and we ended up playing a round before dinner. It was a ton of fun and came down to the wire with her beating me at 7 to 6.

It was nice to test out the game without putting a lot of work into it, just to see if we liked it. I will definitely be building a V2, probably out of wood, and definitely with a better paint job. Although this set would definitely make a pretty good/light travel set if I made a little pouch to carry everything.

Stay tuned for V2 and see you next week!
