<h2 id="harper">Harper</h2>
<p>Detective Strauss stepped through the hospital&rsquo;s double front door and immediately wanted a smoke. There was just something about hospitals that got under his skin. He gritted his teeth and pushed the feeling down. He was a cop damnit and on duty. Getting his bearings, he made his way to the ER wing, where he found a very green and stiff uniform standing outside a curtained off area.</p>
<p>“Sir!” Officer green bellowed snapping to attention.</p>
<p>“Christ, keep it down officer, you’re in a freaking hospital.”</p>
<p>Strauss had been a detective in the illegals division now for the better part of a decade. He’d made the transition from Homicide because he thought it would be better…he’d thought he’d be able to help more, before people took things too far and wound-up dead. He’d been wrong. Now he got to see what people did to each other, or themselves, and they still usually ended up dead. He’d been working on building a case against a local dealer going by the name Gucci. Gucci had come to Strauss’s attention by claiming several high schools as his territory. He’d been close to making an arrest when his sergeant called this morning and told him someone had gone to town and beat the shit out of the little puss ball.</p>
<p>So here he was in the hospital, about to interview the sad fuck and probably arrest some father who had gotten a little pissed off after his sweet innocent daughter got caught with ecstasy.</p>
<p>Strauss nodded his head to the curtain and spoke quietly, “How’s our guy?”</p>
<p>Officer green relaxed a little and glanced behind him at the curtain, “He was really worked over detective, the doc says he is stable, but will have to stay in the hospital for at least the next couple of days before he can be moved. No one has tried to see him besides the staff.”</p>
<p>Strauss nodded again, “He say anything yet?”</p>
<p>“No, sir.” he paused as if debating whether to say something.</p>
<p>“Go ahead officer” Strauss prodded curiously.</p>
<p>“It’s just that… After seeing the state he was in when I was told to come down here, I ran him. He has a sheet a mile long! If he were this worked over by a customer or some vengeful parent, I would think you wouldn’t be able to shut him up.”</p>
<p>Strauss smiled, there was some brain behind all that starch, now he just needed the green knocked off him. “Thanks officer…Peabody. Go take a 10min break while I talk to him.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, sir.”</p>
<p>Strauss turned on his recorder and slipped through the curtain. Peabody had been right, the Gucci laying in the hospital bed was a far cry from the surveillance photos and video that Strauss had seen. Gucci’s real name was Thomas Brennen. He was 28 and had grown up in the Boston suburb that he now dealt in. He had dirty blond hair, a rather good tan and a face that was nice enough it worked to draw in the high school girls who didn’t know any better. Now his left arm and leg were both in casts, and his face looked like it’d been used as a punching bag. Gucci managed to open one eye at the sound of Strauss coming in.</p>
<p>“Are you the detective?” he asked, wincing with pain as he did.</p>
<p>Strauss nodded, “Looks like you really pissed someone off Gucci. What happened? An angry parent finally get tired of you selling to their high schooler?”</p>
<p>Gucci managed to frown with the side of his face that wasn’t swollen, “I don’t know what you’re talking about&hellip; I fell.”</p>
<p>Strauss couldn’t contain his grin, “You fell?&hellip;” he grabbed the chart off the end of the bed and looked it over, “and in falling, you broke your foot, your leg, 2 ribs, dislocated your arm, broke 4 fingers, and fractured your skull?”</p>
<p>“It was a bad fall.” Gucci insisted.</p>
<p>Strauss nodded, “Ok, where did you fall?”</p>
<p>“The stairs at my apartment building.”</p>
<p>Strauss sighed, “You live in a second-floor walkup, you expect me to believe that falling one flight of stairs did all this?</p>
<p>Gucci tried to shift uncomfortably but the pain was too much, and he fell back.</p>
<p>“What do you want from me detective?”</p>
<p>“I want to know what happened. If it really was some parent that beat you, you’d be screaming for me to go arrest them. If it was some other low life druggie that was aiming for your territory, why didn’t they kill you?”</p>
<p>Gucci glanced out the window at the grey morning sky. “As I said, I fell.”</p>
<p>Strauss studied him for a moment in silence, obviously Gucci was afraid of whoever had beaten him. He needed incentive to talk.</p>
<p>“You wanna know something funny?” Strauss asked, waiting for Gucci to meet his gaze, “I was finalizing the paperwork for the arrest of one Thomas Brennen aka Gucci this morning when I got the call you were here. If they had waited just two more days, you would have been off the street and in jail. So whatever reason you have for not talking to me, you’re not going back on the street either way. As soon as the doctor ok’s it, you are going to be moved to a holding cell. Your old life is done.” He let Gucci stew on that for a moment. “Now, the question is, are you in a holding cell with other convicts? Or do you get one all to yourself&hellip;choice is yours&hellip;”</p>
<p>Strauss could see him mulling it over, Gucci had always been a little stupid.</p>
<p>“You can make sure I’m alone and protected?” Gucci asked, Strauss nodded.</p>
<p>Gucci licked his lips, “Maybe&hellip; there’s a new player in town. Maybe this new guy has a certain code.”</p>
<p>Strauss leaned back and crossed his legs, he’d heard rumblings on the street that someone new had come onto the scene, but he hadn’t put any stock in it. Just the usual crap that druggies spout.</p>
<p>“You’re going to have to give me more than maybe’s Gucci&hellip;. what do you mean they have a code?”</p>
<p>Gucci stared at the ceiling for a long moment before speaking again, “Maybe I was approached by these guys the other week, they told me my business was now in an area that was off limits. In exchange my business was going to be annexed and I would be compensated when I turned over the rest of my property and left town.”</p>
<p>Strauss had to admire the balls of this new guy. “You of course politely accepted their offer and bid them a good day.”</p>
<p>Gucci snorted, “Fuck no! I laughed and told them to shove it before it was too late.” He paused as another wave of pain hit him. “I thought that was the end of it. I asked around and heard that a couple others were made the same offer.”</p>
<p>“That brings us to yesterday&hellip;” Strauss prompted.</p>
<p>Gucci shook his head, “What day is today?”</p>
<p>“Sunday.”</p>
<p>“So, Friday evening, I’m packing it up for the evening and this van rolls up and 4 big ass guys get out. One of them flashed some heat and motioned for me to get in the van. You probably know I don’t work that way, so I got in quick.” he paused as he tried to reposition himself again. “They took me to some warehouse&hellip; I don’t remember a lot past that. Beside the message they gave me from their boss.”</p>
<p>“What was the message Gucci?”</p>
<p>“Things in Boston are changing, there are new rules being implemented. One of them is no dealing to kids.” Gucci paused again, “breaking one of the new rules comes with stiff penalties.”</p>
<p>Strauss thought for a minute, if what Gucci was saying was true it would massively shift the dynamics in Boston.</p>
<p>The Patriarca crime family had been running things in Boston, and really all New England, for over a century now. True, their numbers and power had greatly diminished over the last 50 years with in-fighting and arrests. But they still ran the show. Nothing happened in Boston without at least their tacit approval. But not once had Strauss heard of them caring about street corner dealers.</p>
<p>Strauss rubbed his chin, “Is this more fighting within the Family?”</p>
<p>Gucci shook his head, “The Family don’t give a shit about people like me.”</p>
<p>“I need a name Gucci.”</p>
<p>Gucci was quiet for a long moment as he studied the ceiling again. “Harper.” Gucci spat; it came out more as a curse than a name.</p>
<p>“Just&hellip;Harper?” Strauss asked quizzically.</p>
<p>Gucci nodded.</p>
<p>Strauss left after promising that he’d keep Gucci safe again. He had more questions than when he’d gone in. If there really was someone new in town that was making a move this public, others had to know about it. He pulled out the burner phone he kept in his car and texted one of his CIs for a meet. Pablo was a low-level bagman in the Patriarca family, he kept his head down and his ear to the floor. Almost immediately the phone vibrated in his hand with a reply.</p>
<p>USUAL SPOT, QUINCY MARKET 10AM</p>
<p>Strauss checked the dash clock, it was almost 9:45am, he cursed under his breath and left the parking lot. Pablo must have something good if he wanted to meet this quick.</p>
<p>At exactly 9:59am Strauss dropped onto the bench outside the Boston Markets south entrance, there was a wiry dark skinned man feeding pigeons on the other end of the bench.</p>
<p>“Were you followed Strauss?” Pablo asked, his Irish accent thicker than usual.</p>
<p>“No, no I was not Pablo, but next time&hellip;give me a little more fucking warning. I damn near killed myself getting over here in time.”</p>
<p>Pablo threw out a couple more pieces of bread to the pigeons, “Couldn’t be helped I’m afraid detective. This was the only time I could get away today. I’m assuming you want to ask about Gucci?”</p>
<p>“How’d you know?” Strauss asked, watching the people walking by in the courtyard.</p>
<p>Pablo shrugged, “He might not be the biggest of fish, but his dance partner sure was.”</p>
<p>“So, you’ve heard of Harper as well?” Pablo nodded in response. “What can you tell me?”</p>
<p>“I was in Bella Noche last night, waiting for a drop. Suddenly it goes real quiet as this big fella walks in. He has fists the size of bricks and one hand is all scarred. The boys stop him at the door of course and I hear him tell them he’s there to see Carmen on behalf of Harper. He gets ushered into the back room without even being patted down. My drop came so I had to go and didn’t see him leave, but he was in there for a while I’m told.” Pablo threw the last bit of bread he had and wiped his hands on his pants. “Today there’s talk amongst the ranks. There’s word from the top that all active activities are to be shut down at once until a full review is done for new management.”</p>
<p>“Holy shit.” Strauss let out the breath he didn’t realize he’d been holding. Bella Noche was a well-known Patriarca front, and not just any family member owned it. It belonged to Don Carmen Dinunzio.</p>
<p>“You’re telling me! That&rsquo;s activity in all 23 neighborhoods at a dead stop. People are not happy.”</p>
<p>“Are you saying that you think the entire Patriarca family now reports to this person Harper? And they initiated this coup without a single fight or even showing their face?”</p>
<p>Pablo sparred Strauss a quick glance, “Yes.”</p>
<p>“The Patriarca family has been its own worst enemy for the better part of 40 years now, you think they somehow magically got over all the backstabbing for some unknown outsider?”</p>
<p>“Yes, and that fact is what made me meet with you so quickly. If there is indeed a new Don, and they’ve managed to stop all the in-fighting&hellip;.it’s going to be very unlikely that I can talk to you again. A full review&hellip;they might notice, and I don’t want to end up like Gucci. It was a damn good message to the rest of us. See you around detective.” With that parting note, Pablo got up and melted into the surrounding crowd.</p>
<p>Strauss sat for another couple of minutes thinking about what Pablo had told him. This was going to be a shitstorm no matter what happened. He sighed and got to his feet, time to go ruin the day of his sergeant and probably a bunch of cops in the organized crime division.</p>
<p>Not far away, a very different meeting was about to take place, but surprisingly related. The man with fists like bricks that Pablo had seen went by the name Kladivo. It meant hammer in his native Czech, an old nickname that had stuck. He didn’t mind the name; it had served him well over the years. He’d spent most of his adult life bouncing from one government to another, putting his strength and ferocity to good use. Harper had found him in South America, working black ops for a country that didn’t want to get its name sullied in the jungle mud. He’d enjoyed working for Harper these past years. It&rsquo;d given him a sense of direction that he hadn’t had before. Plus, the money was nice.</p>
<p>Kladivo rolled his shoulders as he walked up the steps of the infamous Omni Parker hotel. The one thing he wished was that his boss would stop making him go to these meetings in suits. They never fit him. He made his way to the bank of elevators. He rolled his shoulders again as he rode up to the top floor, feeling a satisfying pop in his neck. Stepping into the quite hallway he looked to his left, another burly man in a suit stood in front of one of the penthouse suites with one hand already inside his jacket. Kladivo had personally picked the man for the private security team, but the hand stayed inside the jacket until both of Kladivo’s were visible and down at his side in a non-threatening manner.</p>
<p>Kladivo nodded in approval at the man, “Sir, you’re to go right in.” the guard said with a nod. He took a key card from his jacket and swiped it, unlocking and opening the door for Kladivo.</p>
<p>The suite was spacious and elegant, Kladivo knew the layout by heart as he had personally signed off on the hotel security review before they had come to town.  There was soft classical music playing over the suite’s speakers, Kladivo recognized it as one of Beethoven&rsquo;s as he took a moment to unbutton his suit jacket, better access to his weapon. He moved into the living area, quiet as a panther. Sitting on one of the couches, facing away from him, was a stunning brunette with long hair done up in a ponytail, she was wearing jeans and a simple forest green button up shirt that matched her eyes. She had her feet drawn up on the couch under her as she was engrossed in paperwork from a folder and had more spread out across the room around her.</p>
<p>Kladivo had only taken a couple steps into the room before she spoke without looking up, “How did the meeting go?”</p>
<p>Kladivo sighed, and gave up on being stealthy, he had never once been able to sneak up on her. “Just as you predicted, Ma’am.” He continued into the room and stood at parade-rest to give his report.</p>
<p>Harper looked up from her papers, locking those green eyes onto Kladivo’s for a moment before a hint of a smile crept into them, “Still trying to surprise me, are we?”</p>
<p>His mouth twitched with a smile as well, “One day, Ma’am, one day.” Kladivo knew what people saw when they looked at Harper, it was what she wanted them to see. The careful façade of a non-threatening young woman was impeccable. He also knew that his boss was in a league of her own.</p>
<p>It had surprised Kladivo years ago when he realized how little he had known about this girl he had tied his life to, while she knew everything about him. Usually, he was much more thorough in his research of people he worked with or for. But even with all his skills, he had been able to find out very little about her.</p>
<p>In the years that he had known her, he’d seen her spar with elite black ops specialists and take them down like it was nothing. She was just as at ease in this luxury suite as she was in the mud, rain, and heat of a south American jungle. She was American by birth he was pretty sure, but definitely not US military trained. He knew she spoke at least six languages flawlessly, played the piano, was a master at chess, archery, sharpshooting, and Harper was not her real name.</p>
<p>Harper looked back down at her papers briefly before shuffling them back into the folder and motioning for him to take a seat on the couch across from her, “Anything I should know from the meeting?”</p>
<p>Kladivo shrugged, “As you predicted, Carmen Patriarca doesn’t want a war with you, your reputation was enough to convince him. All activities have been halted as we conduct an audit, and if we’re satisfied Carmen will happily retire with the golden parachute we’ll be providing him.”</p>
<p>Harper nodded, “Good. When can Tommy’s team start on the Audit?”</p>
<p>Tommy was an accounting whiz that Harper had found some years before when he’d scammed an associate out of 3.5 million dollars using a complicated Ponzi scheme. Harper had saved him, paid to get him the best education, then put him to work running the accounting of her growing empire.</p>
<p>“Carmen was going to send over a copy of his books today, so Tommy can start right away. If we need to conduct interviews, we can start those this week.</p>
<p>Harper nodded in satisfaction, “Was our new law of the land message received?”</p>
<p>“It was, we’ve already received several offers of tribute and apologies as people shuffle around the new boundaries.”  Kladivo paused, debating how much Harper wanted to hear.</p>
<p>“What are you debating telling me?”</p>
<p>“We have a source who reports that Gucci is recovering at Mass General. A Detective visited him this morning and your name might have been mentioned.”</p>
<p>Harper smiled, “Really?&hellip;Well, it seems Gucci has more spine than we thought. Who was the detective?”</p>
<p>“A Detective Strauss from Illegals, he apparently also had his eye on Gucci and was working on building a case. We just got to him first.”</p>
<p>“Interesting&hellip;” Harper stared out the window for a moment as she thought, “Keep an eye on him, let me know if anything escalates.”</p>
