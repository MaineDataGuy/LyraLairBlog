[{"categories":null,"content":"Introduction I was recently going through documents on my computer and came across a paper I wrote for my Epistemology philosophy class in college. As I didn\u0026rsquo;t have a solid idea for a blog topic this week, and do really find the content interesting, I thought I would share. Enjoy!\nHume\u0026rsquo;s Problem of Induction- an essay The 17th century Polish alchemist Michael Sendivogius once said \u0026ldquo;Experience is the sole teacher of truth.\u0026rdquo; This is the essence of the scientific and Empiricist mind and in my view completely true. But what can experience tell us? In Hume’s An Enquiry concerning Human understanding he relates his problem of induction and its consequences for Epistemology. This essay will show that rationalism is not the answer, lay out Hume’s argument and conclusions, and show that our grasp of knowledge is impossible for the time being.\nTo start there are two basic paths you can take with Epistemology, either Rationalism or Empiricism. While Rationalism will keep you away from the Hume’s problem it contains its own flaws. Rationalism is the basic idea that you can discover useful information about the world through pure reasoning and logic. For example, Descartes was a rationalist, he reasoned that if he cleared his brain of all the things he had learned over the years and started at the beginning, “I Think, therefore I am,” then he could come to “certain” conclusions about the world around him. The ontological argument for the existence of God is a good example of this. The basic argument is this:\nGod is the most perfect being\nExistence is a perfection (meaning to exist is more perfect then not to)\nTherefore, God exists\nThis is a very basic version of the argument but it still works. While the above argument is logical, it is only true by definition. Nothing about the above argument has anything to do with the world around us, I could just as easily replace God with The Flying Spaghetti Monster and the argument would still make perfect logical sense.\nThe Flying Spaghetti Monster is the most perfect being\nExistence is a perfection (meaning to exist is more perfect then not to)\nTherefore, The Flying Spaghetti Monster exists\nAnd while this method does logically work, it fails in its very purpose to tell us something new or useful about the world around us and so is useless.\nOne of the other major tenants of Rationalism is the idea of innate ideas. Innate ideas are those ideas that are intrinsic in us, they don’t require experience. We are born with them already in us (or our mind); examples of these are mathematical truths (2+2=4), or the idea of God (that he exists, is good, and is all powerful), the concept of time, or other necessary metaphysical principles1 As Hume points out in An Enquiry there are several pitfalls to this theory,\n\u0026gt; [!quote]\n“A blind man can form no notion of colors; a deaf man of sounds. Restore either of them that sense in which he is deficient; by opening this new inlet for his sensations, you also open an inlet for the ideas; and he finds no difficulty in conceiving these objects.” (Hume 168)\nHume’s point here is that if color or sound were innate ideas then a blind or deaf person would know it even without the sense, instead of being “blind” to it until they experience it.\nAnother example of this: Let’s say Sara has been locked in a colorless room all her life; she can have access to any black and white book she wants. She knows from reading everything to know about the color red, its wavelength, its place in the rainbow, what happens when mixing it with other colors, etc…now on her 21st birthday the door is opened and she is allowed to go outside for the first time, where she sees a fire truck, or an apple, or really anything colored. Is this a new experience for her? We all would logically say yes, that seeing the color for the first time is a new experience that she had no idea of before that. If there where innate ideas (and color was innate idea) then the experience of seeing red would not be new. Another counterexample to innate ideas is that of God, if God was an innate idea then every person on earth for all time would have the idea of God, and everybody’s idea would be the same. This is not the case, most eastern societies didn’t even have the concept of God until around the 7th century, and the Americas were even later than that. If God was an innate idea when the European missionaries came over to the Americas they would have found fellow Christians instead of the “pagan heathens.” We also wouldn’t have the vast pile of gods that were once believed in and now aren’t, there are literally thousands of dead gods. (Tremblay)\nSo because Rationalism doesn’t seem to cut it, the only other path available is Empiricism which is defined by the idea that we get all of our knowledge through experience which comes from sense data and the idea that you need evidence for your beliefs. This system seems to be more stable for beliefs because it requires reasons, and it’s not dependent on your other beliefs. With rationalism you can have a set of beliefs that is completely broken from reality but is still self-validating. Empiricism breaks that because it grounds beliefs with necessary justification in experience.2\nAt birth we are no more than Tabula Rasa (Latin for “blank slate,” first proposed by Aristotle but largely forgotten until the late 17th century when John Locke brought it back to the forefront of philosophy) and over time we build upon our knowledge through experiences we have every day, this explains why a deaf man cannot think of a sound, or a blind man cannot conceive of color, or why Sara doesn’t know red before she is 21; they have not experienced it. This is why every culture has different gods, they all had different experiences in their part of the world and so came to create the gods that would best suit their society and the natural phenomena around them. Empiricism answers the questions left by Rationalism and so must be the correct path but it almost certainly leads us toward Hume’s problem of Induction.\nBefore getting to the problem of Induction, we need to understand the foundation for it, and how it arises. In Hume’s view there are two types of information, there are Matters of Fact and Relations of Ideas. Matters of Fact are the ones based on experience; they are empirical and synthetic. All of Science lies here. The other type, Relations of Ideas, is a priori, analytic and necessary. This group includes logic and math. Hume thinks that all of our ideas can fit into one of these two groups. The problem he thinks is trying to get from one side, Relations of Ideas (reasoning), to the other, Matter of Fact (experience) how can we use reasoning and logic to explain the world around us? Hume says we can’t, it’s not possible and that fact leads us to a serious problem.\nHume thinks that all knowledge is like a inverted pyramid, with simple ideas coming from sense data at the bottom and complex ideas (combinations of other ideas, either simple or other complex ideas) building up from those. This is how Hume sees knowledge being based off of experience and takes care of the classic problem of the infinite regress.\nAn interesting counterexample to this that Hume himself brings up but doesn’t resolve is the missing shade of blue. He points out:\n[!quote] “…Suppose, therefore, a person to have enjoyed his sight for thirty years, and to have become perfectly acquainted with the colours of all kinds except one particular shade of blue, for instance, which it never has been his fortune to meet with. Let all the different shades of that colour, except that single one, be placed before him, descending gradually from the deepest to the lightest; it is plain that he will perceive a blank…” (Hume 169)\nThe argument goes like this: say you have a strip of different shades of blue, like they use for painting, ranging from very dark blue to almost white. Now, take one of the shades out of the range and make it so that you can’t tell it was there; then show it to someone who hasn’t seen it before, he will be able to tell that there is a shade missing from the line up. Hume’s point is that if colors are simple ideas from only one sense and the observer hasn’t ever experienced the missing shade, how can he know that a color is missing? If we say that the observer can fill in the missing shade by imagining the combination of the darker and lighter shades on either side of the missing one, this implies that the colors aren’t simple ideas but complex ones or he has innate idea of the missing shade of blue.\nHume continues a couple lines later with:\n[!quote] “…though this instance is so singular, that it is scarcely worth our observing, and does not merit that for it alone we should alter our general maxim” (Hume 169)\nSome might think this is interesting because it seems as though Hume is just trying to sweep this major flaw in his theory under the rug; and maybe the missing shade is more problematic then we thought. If it can apply to sight, what about the other four senses? It does seem that Hume recognizes this when he starts off the example, “…particular shade of blue, for example…” this seems to imply that his choice of color (verses a particular smell, or taste) is arbitrary and could have been something else. First off I don’t think that it can be applied to the other senses, although it might be just custom/habit but I can’t imagine thinking up a missing taste or sound like I can a missing shade of blue. Secondly, as in all things in life, there are outliers and one example of color is no reason to throw out the entire theory, especially when it can be solved.\nI think the only way to resolve the missing shade of blue problem without invoking the notion of innate ideas is to say that colors are complex ideas, which fits with experience. TV’s for example use only three colors to come up with the full spectrum of color that we need to depict the world around us and art students use color wheels to combine colors to make new ones. One might argue that this still requires a basis of colors for mixing, but I think that the error here is in thinking of the colors as separate squares on a grid instead of a continuum like they are found in nature.\nSo on to the problem of Induction, we’ve seen that Relations of Ideas are necessary and have a very firm base but tell us nothing about the world around us, whereas Matters of Fact, while telling us something new about the world around us, are contingent at best and have a somewhat shaky base. If we say that knowledge is based on Matters of Fact, then it’s grounded in experience. But Hume wants to know how direct experience of one object can tell us anything about similar objects or future objects. It also seems like humans have a tendency to connect events by causality. Things must be either a cause or an effect, and this is how we experience the world around us, so we know Knowledge is grounded in experience but it seems like experience relies on causality, but causality relies on experience. How do we connect events that happen in the past to events that might happen in the future? Why do we connect the sound of thunder with the sight of lightning enough to say that during the next thunderstorm with lightning there will be thunder? We know from experience that things can go differently from what we expect yet we still base our actions/decisions off of those predictions.\n[!quote] “I have found that such an object has always been attended with such an effect, and I foresee, that other objects, which are, in appearance, similar, will be attended with similar effects.” (Hume 174)\nThe above statement is the general case; Hume’s point is what logical step do we take to get from the premise to the conclusion? This is the heart of Hume’s problem of Induction; how do we make the leap from direct experience to predicting the future or any other event that we haven’t experienced? Hume points out that there is no solid logical train from one to the other that he can think of:\n[!quote] “The connexion between these propositions is not intuitive. There is required a medium, which may enable the mind to draw such an inference, if indeed it be drawn by reasoning and argument. What that medium is, I must confess, passes my comprehension.” (Hume 174)\nSince we can’t make a leap based on firm logic, how can we then have any knowledge about the world around us? We can’t Hume says but don’t let that stop you:\n\u0026gt; [!quote]\n“And though none but a fool or madman will ever pretend to dispute the authority of experience, or to reject that great guide of human life, it may surely be allowed a philosopher to have so much curiosity at least as to examine the principle of human nature, which gives this mighty authority to experience, and makes us draw advantage from that similarity which nature has placed among different objects” (Hume 175)\nHume’s ultimate conclusion from the problem of Induction is that while we have a serious problem with causality and knowledge in general we would be idiots to ignore experience. This leads him to think that we do the things we do and believe what we believe not because it’s logically justified but because of custom and habit, we do it and accept it because that’s what we’ve done for thousands of years. He also thinks this applies to our belief in an external, independent world.\n[!quote] “all belief of matter of fact or real existence is derived merely from some object, present to the memory or senses, and a customary conjunction between that and some other object…if flame or snow be presented anew to the senses, the mind is carried by custom to expect heat or cold, and believe that such a quality does exist, and will discover itself upon a nearer approach. This belief is the necessary result of placing the mind in such circumstances” (Hume 178)\nWhile I acknowledge that the problem of induction is serious, I can’t follow Hume to his full conclusion. Yes, we do things because of custom and habit and that probably applies to how we perceive the world around us, but the belief that there is an external world is logical simply because of the fact that we have experiences, and that those experience are similar to everyone else’s experiences3. I can only follow Hume to the notion that we can’t be certain about any empirical knowledge; I can’t follow him to there being no external world because that would seem to imply that knowledge is never going to be possible no matter what.\nThrough all of this we have seen how difficult epistemology really is, you not only have to deal with metaphysics but also with philosophy of language, mind, and sometimes science. I think that Hume’s conclusion makes a good point; we would all be daft not to except how much experience and science have helped us throughout history.\nAs we’ve seen Rationalism doesn’t work, but if we take the Empiricist road then we run into Hume’s problem of induction and have trouble finding a basis for knowledge; but while he is content to except the problem of induction and move on I am more of a wait and see kind of person.\nThroughout history there have been great questions raised with no answers provided, this does not mean that there is no answer and we should abandon the question, it simply implies that we have yet to understand enough of the world around us to answer the question. So as with many other hard questions this is one that just requires some more time until we have a grasp of the universe around us. I think in this instance the only logical solution is to fall back on Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle, you can never be certain about anything; especially not about the things you know.\nHow many times during our history have we made a new theory only to have it disproved later? Many times; this fact alone shows how little true knowledge we really have. We have only to look at the scientific world to find evidence of this, quantum entanglement, dark matter, the conveyance of gravity, and the origin of the universe; these are all subjects that are just mysteries now but in time will be solved and laid to the side with the other questions: is the earth flat? How many planets are there? Are we the center of the solar system? So the solution to Hume’s problem of induction is not to dismiss it outright or see it as a impossible and turn away, no, the answer is to accept that right now true knowledge is impossible and only when we have a firm grasp of the universe and world around us can we try to say anything concrete about what we know. This is a formidable task and we might never achieve it; we might be in a race where the finish line keeps moving, but hopefully that’s not the case, hopefully the finish line is just static and just out of our current reach.\nBibliography Hume, David. \u0026ldquo;An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding.\u0026rdquo; Moser, Paul K and Arnold Vander Nat.

There was just something about hospitals that got under his skin. He gritted his teeth and pushed the feeling down. He was a cop damnit and on duty. Getting his bearings, he made his way to the ER wing, where he found a very green and stiff uniform standing outside a curtained off area.\n“Sir!” Officer green bellowed snapping to attention.\n“Christ, keep it down officer, you’re in a freaking hospital.”\nStrauss had been a detective in the illegals division now for the better part of a decade. He’d made the transition from Homicide because he thought it would be better…he’d thought he’d be able to help more, before people took things too far and wound-up dead. He’d been wrong. Now he got to see what people did to each other, or themselves, and they still usually ended up dead. He’d been working on building a case against a local dealer going by the name Gucci. Gucci had come to Strauss’s attention by claiming several high schools as his territory. He’d been close to making an arrest when his sergeant called this morning and told him someone had gone to town and beat the shit out of the little puss ball.\nSo here he was in the hospital, about to interview the sad fuck and probably arrest some father who had gotten a little pissed off after his sweet innocent daughter got caught with ecstasy.\nStrauss nodded his head to the curtain and spoke quietly, “How’s our guy?”\nOfficer green relaxed a little and glanced behind him at the curtain, “He was really worked over detective, the doc says he is stable, but will have to stay in the hospital for at least the next couple of days before he can be moved. No one has tried to see him besides the staff.”\nStrauss nodded again, “He say anything yet?”\n“No, sir.” he paused as if debating whether to say something.\n“Go ahead officer” Strauss prodded curiously.\n“It’s just that… After seeing the state he was in when I was told to come down here, I ran him. He has a sheet a mile long! If he were this worked over by a customer or some vengeful parent, I would think you wouldn’t be able to shut him up.”\nStrauss smiled, there was some brain behind all that starch, now he just needed the green knocked off him. “Thanks officer…Peabody. Go take a 10min break while I talk to him.”\n“Thank you, sir.”\nStrauss turned on his recorder and slipped through the curtain. Peabody had been right, the Gucci laying in the hospital bed was a far cry from the surveillance photos and video that Strauss had seen. Gucci’s real name was Thomas Brennen. He was 28 and had grown up in the Boston suburb that he now dealt in. He had dirty blond hair, a rather good tan and a face that was nice enough it worked to draw in the high school girls who didn’t know any better. Now his left arm and leg were both in casts, and his face looked like it’d been used as a punching bag. Gucci managed to open one eye at the sound of Strauss coming in.\n“Are you the detective?” he asked, wincing with pain as he did.\nStrauss nodded, “Looks like you really pissed someone off Gucci. What happened? An angry parent finally get tired of you selling to their high schooler?”\nGucci managed to frown with the side of his face that wasn’t swollen, “I don’t know what you’re talking about\u0026hellip; I fell.”\nStrauss couldn’t contain his grin, “You fell?\u0026hellip;” he grabbed the chart off the end of the bed and looked it over, “and in falling, you broke your foot, your leg, 2 ribs, dislocated your arm, broke 4 fingers, and fractured your skull?”\n“It was a bad fall.” Gucci insisted.\nStrauss nodded, “Ok, where did you fall?”\n“The stairs at my apartment building.”\nStrauss sighed, “You live in a second-floor walkup, you expect me to believe that falling one flight of stairs did all this?\nGucci tried to shift uncomfortably but the pain was too much, and he fell back.\n“What do you want from me detective?”\n“I want to know what happened. If it really was some parent that beat you, you’d be screaming for me to go arrest them. If it was some other low life druggie that was aiming for your territory, why didn’t they kill you?”\nGucci glanced out the window at the grey morning sky. “As I said, I fell.”\nStrauss studied him for a moment in silence, obviously Gucci was afraid of whoever had beaten him. He needed incentive to talk.\n“You wanna know something funny?” Strauss asked, waiting for Gucci to meet his gaze, “I was finalizing the paperwork for the arrest of one Thomas Brennen aka Gucci this morning when I got the call you were here. If they had waited just two more days, you would have been off the street and in jail. So whatever reason you have for not talking to me, you’re not going back on the street either way. As soon as the doctor ok’s it, you are going to be moved to a holding cell. Your old life is done.” He let Gucci stew on that for a moment. “Now, the question is, are you in a holding cell with other convicts? Or do you get one all to yourself\u0026hellip;choice is yours\u0026hellip;”\nStrauss could see him mulling it over, Gucci had always been a little stupid.\n“You can make sure I’m alone and protected?” Gucci asked, Strauss nodded.\nGucci licked his lips, “Maybe\u0026hellip; there’s a new player in town. Maybe this new guy has a certain code.”\nStrauss leaned back and crossed his legs, he’d heard rumblings on the street that someone new had come onto the scene, but he hadn’t put any stock in it. Just the usual crap that druggies spout.\n“You’re going to have to give me more than maybe’s Gucci\u0026hellip;. what do you mean they have a code?”\nGucci stared at the ceiling for a long moment before speaking again, “Maybe I was approached by these guys the other week, they told me my business was now in an area that was off limits. In exchange my business was going to be annexed and I would be compensated when I turned over the rest of my property and left town.”\nStrauss had to admire the balls of this new guy. “You of course politely accepted their offer and bid them a good day.”\nGucci snorted, “Fuck no! I laughed and told them to shove it before it was too late.” He paused as another wave of pain hit him. “I thought that was the end of it. I asked around and heard that a couple others were made the same offer.”\n“That brings us to yesterday\u0026hellip;” Strauss prompted.\nGucci shook his head, “What day is today?”\n“Sunday.”\n“So, Friday evening, I’m packing it up for the evening and this van rolls up and 4 big ass guys get out. One of them flashed some heat and motioned for me to get in the van. You probably know I don’t work that way, so I got in quick.” he paused as he tried to reposition himself again. “They took me to some warehouse\u0026hellip; I don’t remember a lot past that. Beside the message they gave me from their boss.”\n“What was the message Gucci?”\n“Things in Boston are changing, there are new rules being implemented. One of them is no dealing to kids.” Gucci paused again, “breaking one of the new rules comes with stiff penalties.”\nStrauss thought for a minute, if what Gucci was saying was true it would massively shift the dynamics in Boston.\nThe Patriarca crime family had been running things in Boston, and really all New England, for over a century now. True, their numbers and power had greatly diminished over the last 50 years with in-fighting and arrests. But they still ran the show. Nothing happened in Boston without at least their tacit approval. But not once had Strauss heard of them caring about street corner dealers.\nStrauss rubbed his chin, “Is this more fighting within the Family?”\nGucci shook his head, “The Family don’t give a shit about people like me.”\n“I need a name Gucci.”\nGucci was quiet for a long moment as he studied the ceiling again. “Harper.” Gucci spat; it came out more as a curse than a name.\n“Just\u0026hellip;Harper?” Strauss asked quizzically.\nGucci nodded.\nStrauss left after promising that he’d keep Gucci safe again. He had more questions than when he’d gone in. If there really was someone new in town that was making a move this public, others had to know about it. He pulled out the burner phone he kept in his car and texted one of his CIs for a meet. Pablo was a low-level bagman in the Patriarca family, he kept his head down and his ear to the floor. Almost immediately the phone vibrated in his hand with a reply.\nUSUAL SPOT, QUINCY MARKET 10AM\nStrauss checked the dash clock, it was almost 9:45am, he cursed under his breath and left the parking lot. Pablo must have something good if he wanted to meet this quick.\nAt exactly 9:59am Strauss dropped onto the bench outside the Boston Markets south entrance, there was a wiry dark skinned man feeding pigeons on the other end of the bench.\n“Were you followed Strauss?” Pablo asked, his Irish accent thicker than usual.\n“No, no I was not Pablo, but next time\u0026hellip;give me a little more fucking warning. I damn near killed myself getting over here in time.”\nPablo threw out a couple more pieces of bread to the pigeons, “Couldn’t be helped I’m afraid detective. This was the only time I could get away today. I’m assuming you want to ask about Gucci?”\n“How’d you know?” Strauss asked, watching the people walking by in the courtyard.\nPablo shrugged, “He might not be the biggest of fish, but his dance partner sure was.”\n“So, you’ve heard of Harper as well?” Pablo nodded in response. “What can you tell me?”\n“I was in Bella Noche last night, waiting for a drop. Suddenly it goes real quiet as this big fella walks in. He has fists the size of bricks and one hand is all scarred. The boys stop him at the door of course and I hear him tell them he’s there to see Carmen on behalf of Harper. He gets ushered into the back room without even being patted down. My drop came so I had to go and didn’t see him leave, but he was in there for a while I’m told.” Pablo threw the last bit of bread he had and wiped his hands on his pants. “Today there’s talk amongst the ranks. There’s word from the top that all active activities are to be shut down at once until a full review is done for new management.”\n“Holy shit.” Strauss let out the breath he didn’t realize he’d been holding. Bella Noche was a well-known Patriarca front, and not just any family member owned it. It belonged to Don Carmen Dinunzio.\n“You’re telling me! That\u0026rsquo;s activity in all 23 neighborhoods at a dead stop. People are not happy.”\n“Are you saying that you think the entire Patriarca family now reports to this person Harper? And they initiated this coup without a single fight or even showing their face?”\nPablo sparred Strauss a quick glance, “Yes.”\n“The Patriarca family has been its own worst enemy for the better part of 40 years now, you think they somehow magically got over all the backstabbing for some unknown outsider?”\n“Yes, and that fact is what made me meet with you so quickly. If there is indeed a new Don, and they’ve managed to stop all the in-fighting\u0026hellip;.it’s going to be very unlikely that I can talk to you again. A full review\u0026hellip;they might notice, and I don’t want to end up like Gucci. It was a damn good message to the rest of us. See you around detective.” With that parting note, Pablo got up and melted into the surrounding crowd.\nStrauss sat for another couple of minutes thinking about what Pablo had told him. This was going to be a shitstorm no matter what happened. He sighed and got to his feet, time to go ruin the day of his sergeant and probably a bunch of cops in the organized crime division.\nNot far away, a very different meeting was about to take place, but surprisingly related. The man with fists like bricks that Pablo had seen went by the name Kladivo. It meant hammer in his native Czech, an old nickname that had stuck. He didn’t mind the name; it had served him well over the years. He’d spent most of his adult life bouncing from one government to another, putting his strength and ferocity to good use. Harper had found him in South America, working black ops for a country that didn’t want to get its name sullied in the jungle mud. He’d enjoyed working for Harper these past years. It\u0026rsquo;d given him a sense of direction that he hadn’t had before. Plus, the money was nice.\nKladivo rolled his shoulders as he walked up the steps of the infamous Omni Parker hotel. The one thing he wished was that his boss would stop making him go to these meetings in suits. They never fit him. He made his way to the bank of elevators. He rolled his shoulders again as he rode up to the top floor, feeling a satisfying pop in his neck. Stepping into the quite hallway he looked to his left, another burly man in a suit stood in front of one of the penthouse suites with one hand already inside his jacket. Kladivo had personally picked the man for the private security team, but the hand stayed inside the jacket until both of Kladivo’s were visible and down at his side in a non-threatening manner.\nKladivo nodded in approval at the man, “Sir, you’re to go right in.” the guard said with a nod. He took a key card from his jacket and swiped it, unlocking and opening the door for Kladivo.\nThe suite was spacious and elegant, Kladivo knew the layout by heart as he had personally signed off on the hotel security review before they had come to town. There was soft classical music playing over the suite’s speakers, Kladivo recognized it as one of Beethoven\u0026rsquo;s as he took a moment to unbutton his suit jacket, better access to his weapon. He moved into the living area, quiet as a panther. Sitting on one of the couches, facing away from him, was a stunning brunette with long hair done up in a ponytail, she was wearing jeans and a simple forest green button up shirt that matched her eyes. She had her feet drawn up on the couch under her as she was engrossed in paperwork from a folder and had more spread out across the room around her.\nKladivo had only taken a couple steps into the room before she spoke without looking up, “How did the meeting go?”\nKladivo sighed, and gave up on being stealthy, he had never once been able to sneak up on her. “Just as you predicted, Ma’am.” He continued into the room and stood at parade-rest to give his report.\nHarper looked up from her papers, locking those green eyes onto Kladivo’s for a moment before a hint of a smile crept into them, “Still trying to surprise me, are we?”\nHis mouth twitched with a smile as well, “One day, Ma’am, one day.” Kladivo knew what people saw when they looked at Harper, it was what she wanted them to see. The careful façade of a non-threatening young woman was impeccable. He also knew that his boss was in a league of her own.\nIt had surprised Kladivo years ago when he realized how little he had known about this girl he had tied his life to, while she knew everything about him. Usually, he was much more thorough in his research of people he worked with or for. But even with all his skills, he had been able to find out very little about her.\nIn the years that he had known her, he’d seen her spar with elite black ops specialists and take them down like it was nothing. She was just as at ease in this luxury suite as she was in the mud, rain, and heat of a south American jungle. She was American by birth he was pretty sure, but definitely not US military trained. He knew she spoke at least six languages flawlessly, played the piano, was a master at chess, archery, sharpshooting, and Harper was not her real name.\nHarper looked back down at her papers briefly before shuffling them back into the folder and motioning for him to take a seat on the couch across from her, “Anything I should know from the meeting?”\nKladivo shrugged, “As you predicted, Carmen Patriarca doesn’t want a war with you, your reputation was enough to convince him. All activities have been halted as we conduct an audit, and if we’re satisfied Carmen will happily retire with the golden parachute we’ll be providing him.”\nHarper nodded, “Good. When can Tommy’s team start on the Audit?”\nTommy was an accounting whiz that Harper had found some years before when he’d scammed an associate out of 3.5 million dollars using a complicated Ponzi scheme. Harper had saved him, paid to get him the best education, then put him to work running the accounting of her growing empire.\n“Carmen was going to send over a copy of his books today, so Tommy can start right away. If we need to conduct interviews, we can start those this week.\nHarper nodded in satisfaction, “Was our new law of the land message received?”\n“It was, we’ve already received several offers of tribute and apologies as people shuffle around the new boundaries.” Kladivo paused, debating how much Harper wanted to hear.\n“What are you debating telling me?”\n“We have a source who reports that Gucci is recovering at Mass General. A Detective visited him this morning and your name might have been mentioned.”\nHarper smiled, “Really?\u0026hellip;Well, it seems Gucci has more spine than we thought. Who was the detective?”\n“A Detective Strauss from Illegals, he apparently also had his eye on Gucci and was working on building a case. We just got to him first.”\n“Interesting\u0026hellip;” Harper stared out the window for a moment as she thought, “Keep an eye on him, let me know if anything escalates.”\n","permalink":"/posts/8--harper/","tags":["fiction","writing"],"title":"Harper"},{"categories":null,"content":"I thought I\u0026rsquo;d share some more creative writing this week. Below is the beginning of a short story I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on that takes place in the same world as my novel, The Sharpe Chronicles. It\u0026rsquo;s set before the novel takes place and centers around Lucy. Enjoy!\nIt had been a long night and detective Butler was tired, it was now 3:20am, twenty minutes past the end of his shift but unfortunately his Lieutenant had handed him an assignment as he was getting ready to head home. There had been some sort of incident involving a bar in the Mission district. Another detective had been assigned as primary, but the Lieutenant had told Butler to help with the witness interview process. Butler sighed as he heaved himself up from his desk and headed for the interview room.\nButler nodded at the uniformed officer and glanced down at the file in his hand as he walked into the room, “Good morning Mr. …. White, thanks for coming in so early to give your statement.” Butler looked up from his file and smiled at the grizzled old man.\n“Just doing my civic duty; please, call me Alfred.” Alfred responded in a good-natured tone.\nButler relaxed a little; he had been expecting a rant on having to wait so long. “Ok Alfred, let’s start at the beginning- what did you see?”\n“I’ve seen some weird stuff in my day but tonight\u0026hellip;” Alfred fidgeted with the Styrofoam cup of bad station coffee that sat in front of him and frowned. Butler glanced at the officer standing at the door and got a shrug in response.\n“Mr. White…I mean, Alfred\u0026hellip;”\nThe old man interrupted by clearing his throat, “Detective, I joined the army the day I graduated high school. Didn’t do it for the rank like some of the other boys, or the glory the recruiter promised us.”\n“That’s very noble of you Alfred.”\nAlfred waved his hand in dismissal, “That wasn’t what I wanted either, just wanted to serve my country and maybe impress a few girls.” A ghost of a smile crossed his face as he continued to finger his coffee cup. “I’m telling you this, so you know that I’m not someone who likes to tell big stories.”\n“Ok\u0026hellip;.”\n“I am 97 years old and have fought in three different wars: World War 2, Korea, and Vietnam. Let me tell you, I’ve seen some pretty strange things in my time.” Alfred continued with barely a pause. “I once saw a man who was 5 feet from a mortar blast get knocked back 20 feet then just get up and walk away.”\n“Wow, that’s pretty amazing.” Butler said, just to keep the old man talking.\nAlfred shook his head, “But tonight definitely takes the cake.”\n“How so, Alfred?”\n“It probably says in that file you have there, but I work the late shift at Luke’s pub as a line cook, it’s not the best hours but it’s an honest living. Every night for the past 20 years I’ve taken a walk around the neighborhood after my shift. Mind you, the neighborhood has changed a little, but not my route. I walk down 17th street to Mission and then walk all the way down to 23rd street before circling back on Van Ness Ave and walking home.”\nButler looked at his notes, “My notes say the incident was at 24th and Capp St. If you always turn at 23rd, how could you have seen anything?”\n“Because, for the past month I’ve been walking down to 24th to avoid the club.”\n“You mean the club going by the name Belladona?” Butler asked clarifying.\nAlfred nodded, “Yeah…that one that took over the old church.”\n“Why?”\nAlfred shrugged one plaid covered shoulder, “I can’t give you an example or anything, but my gut just said it was some place to stay away from.”\n“Ok, so last night you were walking down 24th Street near the Capp Street crossing…” Butler prompted, scribbling on a notepad.\nAlfred bobbed his head, “Right… so I’m walking down the street, about to cross Capp and I hear shouts from down the block…towards 23rd. Then I hear a loud crash, like a car ran into something. I figured there was an accident, and I might be able to help so I headed up Capp.”\n“What did you find?” Butler prompted after Alfred was quiet for a moment.\nAlfred took a sip of water from the plastic cup sitting on the table in front of him, “I slowed as I got closer to the club. First thing I noticed was a car on fire in the street…”\nButler scribbled another note, “Can you describe the car?”\nAlfred shrugged on shoulder, “I’m not too good with cars, but it was black or dark blue, and it was really nice. A Lexus maybe?”\nButler grunted in acknowledgement and waited for the old man to continue.\n“People weren’t really paying attention to the car though, there were these folks near the door of the club that were looking further down Capp St., so I walked a little further down the other side of the street until I could get a good view.”\n“What did you see?”\nAlfred took another sip of water, “There were these five or six guys all circling around something in the middle of the intersection with 23rd street. They reminded me of a pack of hyenas. As they circled I was able to see between them to what they were focused on.” Alfred paused again, “Mind you, I don’t know what I was expecting, but it certainly wasn’t what I saw! Right in the middle of this group of thugs was this young girl just calm as you could be standing in the middle of the street. How do you like that? I don’t know if I’d be calm with thugs twice my size circling around me.”\nButler paused in his note taking and looked up, “A young girl?”\n“Yeah! I was as surprised as you are! It took me a second for me to get over my shock.”\n“Can you describe her?”\nAlfred scratched his chin, “Well let’s see… she was wearing jeans and a pretty form fitting t-shirt if you know what I mean…and she couldn’t have been older than 26 or 27. I think she had brown hair? Yeah, longish brown hair that was up in a ponytail.”\nButler scribbled down Alfred’s description, “Ok, what happened next?”\n“Well, when I finally got over the shock, I took a couple steps forward. Guess my brain wanted my body to help or somethin’…don’t know how helpful I could be at my age, but I was gonna try. They definitely weren’t there to help the poor girl.”\nButler looked over what he could see of Alfred White, besides a little sweat the old vet seemed perfectly fine, and didn’t seem to be injured or anything. “You seem to have done pretty well for yourself.”\nAlfred let out a bark of laughter, “I wish! I had every intention of lending a hand and getting my butt whipped, but that young woman had it completely handled. The moment I stepped forward they rushed in to attack her and man could they fight!”\nButler frowned and was about to speak when Alfred continued, “Mind you, my eyes aren’t what they used to be, and I was never one for the hand-to-hand fighting, but from what I saw, any one of those guys could have easily gone round for round with any boxing champion…. And you know what?”\n“What?” Butler responded, knowing his queue.\n“Not a single one of them laid a pinky on that woman. It was a sight to behold.”\n“What do you mean, she managed to get away?”\nAlfred shook his head emphatically, “No! She didn’t even attempt to run away. I swear, they would go to punch her, and she just wouldn’t be there anymore. I don’t know how else to explain it, it was like watching a fight movie with frames missing. One second, they would be in one place, then BLAM! They would be standing 10 feet to their left like they’d never moved.”\nButler flicked a glance at the officer standing by the door, “You said your eyes aren’t what they used to be Alfred?”\nAlfred sighed, “Look, I know what I’m telling you sounds out there, and my eyes definitely aren’t as sharp as they used to be. But I still have 20/20, never needed glasses a day in my life.”\nButler stared at Alfred for a second before nodding, “Ok, what happened next?”\n“As I said, it was like watching a fight movie with frames missing… all of a sudden, the thugs started dropping like flies. I didn’t even see the girl throw a punch, but first one thug went flying back, then another slammed into the side of a car. Then a third and fourth went skidding down the street in the opposite direction. Then things got a little weird.”\n“Then things got weird?” Butler asked incredulously.\nAlfred nodded, “The thug that had been thrown against the side of the car? Well, he shouted something in a foreign language out of frustration, I think he called the girl Lucy and picked up the car and threw it at her.”\nThere was silence in the small interview room as Detective Butler processed what Alfred had said.\nFinally, Butler spoke, “Did you say he picked up the car?”\nAlfred nodded and mimed picking up a box on his right with two hands and throwing it to his left, “Yup, I almost didn’t believe it either, but since I was directly in the path of the car as it hit the ground and slid, I got a very good view.” Alfred paused to take another sip of water, “I probably would have been a goner if it hadn’t of been for that girl… I heard her sigh, then all of a sudden, she was right in front of me and the car had stopped and was sitting on its passenger side.”\n“Uh huh…” Butler managed to say.\n“I guess I made a sound or something because the girl turned around and looked at me with this blazing smile on her face.\n“Did she say anything?”\nAlfred smiled, “Yeah, she apologized for the others’ behaviors and wished me a good night.”\n“She apologized for the behavior of the thugs that attacked her?”\nAlfred nodded, puzzled, “I know, weird right?”\nButler sighed, “What happened next?”\nAnother shrug from Alfred, “I heard the police sirens at that point, the whole lot of them seemed to act as one and leave. The thugs, the girl, even the people watching from the club. Few seconds later, seemed like I was the only one there. Then the police showed up. You know the rest Detective.”\nDetective Butler leaned back in his chair and stared at Alfred, he couldn’t tell if the old man was just pulling his chain, crazy, or actually telling the truth.\n“Mr. White, first on scene does confirm that there was a car on its side in the intersection of 23rd and Capp Street, and that there was another car, a Black BMW, on fire a 100 feet or so away from the intersection…”\nAlfred nodded at Butlers words, “I told you I wasn’t good with cars.”\n“…But” Butler continued, “We talked to the owner of the club known as Belladonna’s and he said they were closed last night.”\nAlfred frowned, “That can’t be right, there were at least 10-15 people hanging outside the club watching.\nDetective Butler sighed and looked at the clock on the wall; it was now 4:15am, way past when he should be home in bed. He didn’t think Alfred was lying to him, but the story the old man told was just nuts. “Mr. White, is there anything you want to add or change maybe?”\nAlfred was still frowning down at the table, “Why would they say the club was closed?” he asked looking up at to meet Butler’s gaze.\n“I dunno,” Butler responded gathering his papers together and pulling one of his cards out of his pocket, “But if you think of anything else, please let me know.” He slid the card across the table and stood gesturing to the uniformed officer, “This officer will show you out.”\n“Yeah, yeah… you too, Detective.” Alfred said still a little distracted as he hauled himself to his feet.\nDetective Butler let out another long breath and walked back to his desk to write up a quick report before he headed home.\nAs Butler wrote up his report and fantasied about his bed, Alfred White walked the few short blocks from the precinct to his dark apartment amazed at the eventful night he’d had. He had unlocked his door and stepped inside before his old army senses kicked in and he realized he wasn’t alone in the apartment.\n“Hello?” Alfred called out softly as he closed the door behind him.\nA lamp in the living room clicked on, illuminating the young woman he had seen early that evening, “Hello Alfred.”\nAlfred took a couple steps forward into the living room, “It’s you… I was just talking about you with a Detective Butler.”\nThe woman smiled brilliantly, “All good things I hope?”\nAlfred couldn’t help but smile back, “Well to be honest miss it was mostly just weird, and I’m pretty sure he didn’t believe most of what I said.” Thinking back on what he’d seen, a look of puzzlement captured Alfred’s face, and he scratched his head, “Matter of fact, I don’t know if I would believe it either.”\nThe woman nodded with a sympathetic look on her face, “It is a lot to process for people.”\nA tingle started at the back of Alfred’s mind, “Miss, may I ask why you are here sitting in my living room? Are you here to kill me or something?”\nThe woman stood in one fluid motion and took a couple steps forward, “Of course not Alfred! But those memories you have from earlier might be viewed as dangerous by some. I’m just here to take that burden off your shoulders.”\nAlfred was still a little confused, but he’d just noticed the young woman’s eyes. They were an amazing violet, he didn’t think he’d ever seen anything quite like them, and they were so hypnotizing.\n“Ok…. But how are you gonna do that?” Alfred mumbled out. His mind was starting to get a little fuzzy with tiredness.\n“Don’t you worry about it,” the woman’s calming voice responded as she took Alfred’s arm and led him to his bedroom, “When you wake up, you’ll be well rested, and you won’t remember any of this.”\nAlfred tried to talk around the haze, “Are you gonna talk to Detective Butler as well? It would be nice if he knew I wasn’t telling tales.”\nAlfred’s eye’s closed before he even hit the bed, the last thing he heard before drifting off to sleep was the woman’s calming voice reassuring him.\nLucy quietly left Alfred’s apartment, locking the door behind her and giving a cheery ‘good morning!’ to the stunned woman just leaving for work across the hall. She donned her wide brimmed hat and sunglasses and walked down the three flights of stairs to the street and disappeared into the early morning bustle of commuters.\n","permalink":"/posts/7-lucy-short-story/","tags":["fiction","Sharpe_chronicles"],"title":"A short story for Lucy"},{"categories":null,"content":"Premise I had the idea a couple weeks ago to try and use a song, or music video as the inspiration for a creative writing bit. I went back and forth on what song to use, do I use one of the songs from my favorite band? Walk the Moon? or one of my more recent discoveries\u0026hellip; AJR? George Ezra?\nNope, I decided on Tones and I. You might know them by one of their hit singles, Dance Monkey from 2019. One of their more recent albums is called Welcome to the Madhouse from 2021. There are two songs, the title song \u0026lsquo;Welcome to the Madhouse\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Won\u0026rsquo;t Sleep\u0026rsquo; which I sort of confuzzled in my mind, lol.

It\u0026rsquo;d been a rough time to be party planner, but she had scrimped and saved. Working 14 hour days to cook, bartend, and serve every little gig that she could book. Slowly, she\u0026rsquo;d built up her reputation, working her way from doing small bar mitzvah\u0026rsquo;s and weddings in the local community centers to corporate retreats, then came the political charity fundraisers and c list celebrity parties.\nAfter climbing as far as she could in Chicago, she decided to move her main operation to New York City, again, putting her profits back into the company and expanding her capabilities. Now, with five years in the city that never sleeps, Michelle was the go to event planner for the most decerning of clients. she\u0026rsquo;d regularly put on single night events for 600+ people, flying in exotic chefs and entertainment from around the world. Vogue had even asked her to run the new Met Gala after it decided to restart in 2046.\nAnd yet, she\u0026rsquo;d been feeling restless for a little while now. she wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure what challenge to turn her sights on next. That\u0026rsquo;s when the letter had arrived from Mad House.\nDuring the early days of the urban wars, most secret societies had been targeted by the masses. The wealthy were seen as the new bourgeoise and had to therefore pay the prize for the anger that had been building for decades. The ivy league universities were also targeted, bombed and looted repeatedly, their very names and anyone or anything associated with them becoming almost untenable in main stream America. But when chaos reins, like it did during the urbans, people tended to band together for community. Many secret societies, clubs, and cults were born during those years, but few actually survived. Mad House was one of the few that survived, and actually thrived on the chaos.\nMad House was ostensibly a club, some might call it a secret society, but it was way too well known for that. The single overriding principle of the group was:\nLife is chaos, so seize the moment.\nMembership rosters were closely guarded, and by invitation only. They prided themselves on taking members from all walks of life, the only known stipulation being a open mind. It was rumored that they only had a few other membership requirements, but one thing was for sure, they were powerful and had their fingers everywhere. A reputable reporter had published a story a few years back on the top 10 celeb\u0026rsquo;s and politicians that were members. The next day the story had literally been wiped from the net and the reporter had issued a retraction and their resignation.\nIt was also rumored that they held a yearly extravagant ball that lasted multiple days, each year it had a different theme and was held in a different location.\nThe letter was on a crisp white piece of heavy paper. At the top was an embossed logo, a stylized letter \u0026ldquo;M\u0026rdquo; inside a shield with flames in in the background.\nMichelle slowly opened the letter and began to read, with each sentence she could feel her excitement raise another notch. This was the challenge she had been waiting for.\nMad House wanted her to plan next years ball. It was going to be right here in New York. The letter also contained a business card. On it, in neat print was only a contact number to contact with her answer. Further information would be provided once she\u0026rsquo;d signed the contract and NDA.\nShe didn\u0026rsquo;t need to think about it for very long, this was going to be the opportunity of a lifetime. she pulled out her communicator and input the contact number. The line connected and an automated voice told her to leave a message.\n\u0026ldquo;Hi, this is Michelle Yost, I am calling to say I accept the offer and am looking forward to getting to work soon.\u0026rdquo; nervously she disconnected the line and cleared her throat.\nHow long would she have to wait? she assumed they would have done all the necessary research into her before making the offer, but who knows how often they even checked that mailbox?\nShe was just starting to feel a little silly sitting there waiting in her office when her communicator beeped. A encrypted call from an unknown contact.\nNervously, she picked up the device and hit accept.\n\u0026hellip; to be continued\u0026hellip;\n","permalink":"/posts/6-story-from-a-song/","tags":["writing_prompt","fiction"],"title":"Story from a Song"},{"categories":null,"content":"Short post this week, I spent the first couple days this week battling a headache that just wouldn\u0026rsquo;t go away!\nNeedless to say, my creative drive was severely diminished.\nI decided to end my week with a little project to do a heat transfer vinyl design on a shirt with the Cricut Explorer 3 that my amazing wife got me for Christmas.\nI did a run to wally world to get a blank shirt (their plain t-shirt stock was surprisingly horrendous by the way\u0026hellip;definitely won\u0026rsquo;t be going there again any time soon!). Then I fired up the ol\u0026rsquo; Cricut design studio to figure out what I wanted. I had a basic idea from some inspiration I\u0026rsquo;ve seen around the interwebs, and the process was surprisingly painless.\nI loaded up the iron-on vinyl in the Cricut and told it to cut out my design! it immediately failed. lol\u0026hellip; It was asking for a mat that was 12\u0026quot; x 24\u0026quot; and I only had a 12\u0026quot; x 12\u0026quot;, so I shrunk the design a little and tried again. This time it didn\u0026rsquo;t complain and efficiently cut out my design\u0026hellip;and second failure, lol. I had put the vinyl on backwards, so it had scored the transfer tape, instead of cutting the vinyl. Ok, third times the charm, I flipped the vinyl sheet over and hit go again. Success!\nA quick cut and some light weeding (peeling off the little bits of vinyl that you don\u0026rsquo;t want around your design) later, I\u0026rsquo;m finally ready to iron on the design to the shirt. I positioned the design where I wanted it on the shirt, put some parchment paper over it to protect it. Then pressed down for 30-40 seconds with the iron set to cotton.\nAnd, presto! A new shirt created!\n!\rIf you don\u0026rsquo;t recognize the symbol, I don\u0026rsquo;t blame you\u0026hellip;much, lol. It\u0026rsquo;s from the classic Sci-Fi series StarGate SQ-1, it\u0026rsquo;s the chevron symbol for Earth. Or, home you might say.\nAll in all, the process was pretty quick and easy, I\u0026rsquo;m definitely curious to play around with it some more. We\u0026rsquo;ll see how the shirt does goes after some wear and wash cycles, but for the price and time, it was well worth it I think.\nHopefully next week I\u0026rsquo;ll get back to my regularly scheduled programming, a post that I\u0026rsquo;ve been actually wanting to do, creative writing based on listening to a song.\nUntil then, have a good week!\n","permalink":"/posts/5-no-place-like-sg1/","tags":["crafts"],"title":"There's no Place like home"},{"categories":null,"content":"The typical question you hear every January is \u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s your New Year resolution?\u0026rdquo; which is great and all, but it\u0026rsquo;s basis for self reflection is through the lens of necessary change. While self reflection is good, the optics of necessary change has the potential to be harmful.\nMy wife asked me a question the other day that seemed like a much more interesting angle on self reflection.\n\u0026ldquo;What did you learn from the past year?\u0026rdquo;\nWithout the burden of needing it to be about change for the new year, I think it gets to the benefit of self reflection much better.\nSo, how about it? what did you learn from 2024?\nMy obvious first quip was: Don\u0026rsquo;t underestimate the depths of the general publics desire to work against their own self interests \u0026hellip; electing a convicted felon who has flat out said he wants to get rid of democracy will definitely tamper your hope for humanity a little.\nBut after a little more thought I\u0026rsquo;ve come to two lessons learned from the past year.\n[!First] However much time you think a project will take, add at least 20%.\nI feel like multiple projects last year started with me thinking \u0026ldquo;oh yeah, I can definitely get that done in a weekend!\u0026rdquo; low and behold, some complication crops up that I had to work through, or the ground is made out of pure clay and I don\u0026rsquo;t have a teenage nephew at hand anymore for the hard digging, or I don\u0026rsquo;t have the right bit and have to run to the store to buy a new one.\nWhatever the case may be (not saying those happened or anything) give yourself time to work things out. You\u0026rsquo;ll also feel better about the project if you don\u0026rsquo;t feel rushed to finish it by a tight deadline. This has already come up in 2025 for me, giving myself a deadline for getting blog posts out weekly definitely is tighter than I probably should have gone.\n[!Second] ABL! Always be learning!\nOk, this one wasn\u0026rsquo;t something I specifically learned from 2024, and I\u0026rsquo;ve definitely been heard saying it long before then, but it felt more apt in 2024. I started multiple hobby\u0026rsquo;s/crafts, projects that pushed the bounds of my knowledge and I think I\u0026rsquo;m better for it. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t really matter what you learning (as long as it interests you or is useful!) but expanding your knowledge I think is always good.\nI started actual sewing projects trying to make my own clothes and gear, it definitely makes you see your wardrobe in a totally different light. I took classes on Python, a programming language, and it\u0026rsquo;s opened up new ideas for both work and personal processes that I could improve. Even small things, like adding a server to our home network gave me ideas for this blog or got me more comfortable with CLI (command line interface).\nSo whatever your own answer is, realize that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t necessitate change for the new year, but also don\u0026rsquo;t shy away from change. If you like where you\u0026rsquo;re at, great! keep doing that. If after some self reflection you see things that you want to change, also great! And if you do want to implement change, also remember it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to wait until the new year, go ahead and start learning that new skill or breaking that habit in July if you want!\nUntil next week!\n-Sam\n","permalink":"/posts/4-lessons-learned-from-2024/","tags":["writing_prompt"],"title":"New year, same problems"},{"categories":null,"content":"Short post this week due to the holiday\u0026rsquo;s.\nA few weeks ago I came across this YouTube video by Skill tree\nBoth Nine Men\u0026rsquo;s Morris and The Royal Game of Ur (RGU) looked really fun and simple to make. I also do have a bunch of scrap 2x2\u0026rsquo;s that would work great for RGU, and fortunately a bunch of black and white markers that I for some reason got from my dad years ago.\nAfter procrastinating the RGU project for weeks as other things got in the way (basement craft table, holiday lego night, actual holiday\u0026rsquo;s) I was doing some random exploring on Thingaverse\rand found found a model for RGU. Perfect!

Unfortunately I only had a couple choices at the moment for paints, and as a V1 it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter a ton anyways.

I have a new board game to play with!\n![[Pasted image 20241231110704.png| 350]]\nI showed my newest creation to Sarah, and we ended up playing a round before dinner. It was a ton of fun and came down to the wire with her beating me at 7 to 6.\nIt was nice to test out the game without putting a lot of work into it, just to see if we liked it. I will definitely be building a V2, probably out of wood, and definitely with a better paint job. Although this set would definitely make a pretty good/light travel set if I made a little pouch to carry everything.\nStay tuned for V2 and see you next week!\n","permalink":"/posts/3-royal-game-of-ur/","tags":["board_games","3D_printing"],"title":"Making a new game"},{"categories":null,"content":"Dark shadows at the window Dark houses are silent.

Maybe this is the issue? the way my creative brain works it\u0026rsquo;s much harder to fill in the gaps of the story then to just let it flow naturally.\nWhatever the reason, it\u0026rsquo;s now the end of 2024 and the second book only has about 25 pages actually written. This writers block has some serious strength to it!. I\u0026rsquo;ve repeatedly put it aside, hoping that inspiration will come only to pick it up months later and still be at a loss after a few words or sentences.\nAnother possibility is that I got involved with my amazing wife, Sarah, around the same time as I published book number one and started working on book number two. Having a partner has brought immense joy into my life, but definitely limits some of my time that I previously spent creatively writing, lol. Was creative writing something I did because I was lonely before?? Who knows!\nWhatever the reasons, I\u0026rsquo;ve been very frustrated by my writers block for awhile now and haven\u0026rsquo;t figured out a way around it. Recently I was watching a very interesting YouTube video by NetworkChuck Starting a blog in 2024\r. The idea of mixing two of my interests, the technical data automation side, and the creative writing aspect peaked my interest.\nAnd boy, has it been interesting so far! NetworkChuck\u0026rsquo;s walkthrough video and his own blog post helped a ton, but there was definitely some technical troubleshooting that I had to do myself to get everything working as it should (and more to come, as you might notice, the logo on the website still isn\u0026rsquo;t loading). I will say that I am really liking Obsidian.md as a note and writing tool.\nSo, finally, what is the objective of the blog?\nWell, I\u0026rsquo;m going to give my self the objective of posting at least once a week in 2025, that\u0026rsquo;s 52 posts. Hopefully the act of writing, about whatever I feel like that week, will help the creative spark flourish in my other writing projects as well. Some might be a little technical, some might be about other crafty projects I\u0026rsquo;m working on, some might be creative writing\u0026hellip;the point is just to get back into writing!\nUntil next week and wishing everyone a good end of the year!\n-Sam\n","permalink":"/posts/2-reason-for-the-blog/","tags":["blog","first_post"],"title":"Reason for the Blog"},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"/manifest.json","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"/search/_index.de/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"/search/_index.es/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"/search/_index.fr/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"/search/_index.hi/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"/search/_index.jp/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"/search/_index.nl/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"/search/_index.pl/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"/search/_index.ru/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"/search/_index.zh-cn/","tags":null,"title":""}]
