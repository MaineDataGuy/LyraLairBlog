The typical question you hear every January is "What's your New Year resolution?" which is great and all, but it's basis for self reflection is through the lens of necessary change. While self reflection is good, the optics of necessary change has the potential to be harmful. 

My wife asked me a question the other day that seemed like a much more interesting angle on self reflection. 

"What did you learn from the past year?"

Without the burden of needing it to be about change for the new year, I think it gets to the benefit of self reflection much better.

So, how about it? what did you learn from 2024?

My obvious first quip was: *Don't underestimate the depths of the general publics desire to work against their own self interests* ... electing a convicted felon who has flat out said he wants to get rid of democracy will definitely tamper your hope for humanity a little.

But after a little more thought I've come to two lessons learned from the past year.


> [!First] 
> However much time you think a project will take, add at least 20%. 

I feel like multiple projects last year started with me thinking "oh yeah, I can definitely get that done in a weekend!" low and behold, some complication crops up that I had to work through, or the ground is made out of pure clay and I don't have a teenage nephew at hand anymore for the hard digging, or I don't have the right bit and have to run to the store to buy a new one.

Whatever the case may be (not saying those happened or anything) give yourself time to work things out. You'll also feel better about the project if you don't feel rushed to finish it by a tight deadline. *This has already come up in 2025 for me, giving myself a deadline for getting blog posts out weekly definitely is tighter than I probably should have gone.*


> [!Second] 
>   ABL! Always be learning!

Ok, this one wasn't something I specifically learned from 2024, and I've definitely been heard saying it long before then, but it felt more apt in 2024. I started multiple hobby's/crafts, projects that pushed the bounds of my knowledge and I think I'm better for it. It doesn't really matter what you learning (as long as it interests you or is useful!) but expanding your knowledge I think is always good. 

I started actual sewing projects trying to make my own clothes and gear, it definitely makes you see your wardrobe in a totally different light. I took classes on Python, a programming language, and it's opened up new ideas for both work and personal processes that I could improve. Even small things, like adding a server to our home network gave me ideas for this blog or got me more comfortable with CLI (command line interface).

So whatever your own answer is, realize that it doesn't necessitate change for the new year, but also don't shy away from change. If you like where you're at, great! keep doing that. If after some self reflection you see things that you want to change, also great! And if you do want to implement change, also remember it doesn't have to wait until the new year, go ahead and start learning that new skill or breaking that habit in July if you want!

Until next week!
