      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;premise&#34;&gt;Premise&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I had the idea a couple weeks ago to try and use a song, or music video as the inspiration for a creative writing bit. I went back and forth on what song to use, do I use one of the songs from my favorite band? Walk the Moon? or one of my more recent discoveries&amp;hellip; AJR? George Ezra?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nope, I decided on Tones and I. You might know them by one of their hit singles, Dance Monkey from 2019. One of their more recent albums is called Welcome to the Madhouse from 2021. There are two songs, the title song &amp;lsquo;Welcome to the Madhouse&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Won&amp;rsquo;t Sleep&amp;rsquo; which I sort of confuzzled in my mind, lol. The song I was thinking of was &amp;lsquo;Welcome to the Madhouse&amp;rsquo; but &amp;lsquo;Won&amp;rsquo;t Sleep&amp;rsquo; has a music video that kept popping into my mind as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
