[{"categories":null,"content":"Short post this week due to the holiday\u0026rsquo;s.\nA few weeks ago I came across this YouTube video by Skill tree\nBoth Nine Men\u0026rsquo;s Morris and The Royal Game of Ur (RGU) looked really fun and simple to make. I also do have a bunch of scrap 2x2\u0026rsquo;s that would work great for RGU, and fortunately a bunch of black and white markers that I for some reason got from my dad years ago.\nAfter procrastinating the RGU project for weeks as other things got in the way (basement craft table, holiday lego night, actual holiday\u0026rsquo;s) I was doing some random exploring on Thingaverse\rand found found a model for RGU. Perfect! I have a 3D printer (the AnkerMake M5C), I\u0026rsquo;ll just print off a board, give it a little paint job and then I can test out the game before putting more time into a wooden version!\nThe board took about 2 hours to print and came out pretty good, although the edges need some clean up. ![[Pasted image 20241231105628.png| 300]]\nI printed out 4 of the tetrahedral dice as well, and took the lot out to the garage to sand and decide how I wanted to paint them. Unfortunately I only had a couple choices at the moment for paints, and as a V1 it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter a ton anyways. I figured denoting the starting location, and the extra move squares would probably be the best, and voila! I have a new board game to play with!\n![[Pasted image 20241231110704.png| 350]]\nI showed my newest creation to Sarah, and we ended up playing a round before dinner. It was a ton of fun and came down to the wire with her beating me at 7 to 6.\nIt was nice to test out the game without putting a lot of work into it, just to see if we liked it. I will definitely be building a V2, probably out of wood, and definitely with a better paint job. Although this set would definitely make a pretty good/light travel set if I made a little pouch to carry everything.\nStay tuned for V2 and see you next week!\n","permalink":"/posts/royal-game-of-ur/","tags":["board_games","3D_printing"],"title":"Making a new game"},{"categories":null,"content":"Dark shadows at the window Dark houses are silent.

Poem that I wrote many years ago\n","permalink":"/posts/poem--men-in-the-night/","tags":["blog","poem"],"title":"Men in the Night"},{"categories":null,"content":"I self published my first book, The Sharpe Chronicles: Alexander\u0026rsquo;s Genesis\r, in December 2016. I really did love the process of writing it, and the reaction of people reading it (those that did!). Since then, I\u0026rsquo;ve tried to work on the sequel, but I\u0026rsquo;ve had so much trouble with inspiration. It also was a completely different process for me the second time around.\nWith the first book, it came from a dream and the plot sort of grew naturally and morphed into the book that was published. With the second, I have a clear sense of where I want to go, and an outline that I want to follow. Maybe this is the issue? the way my creative brain works it\u0026rsquo;s much harder to fill in the gaps of the story then to just let it flow naturally.\nWhatever the reason, it\u0026rsquo;s now the end of 2024 and the second book only has about 25 pages actually written. This writers block has some serious strength to it!. I\u0026rsquo;ve repeatedly put it aside, hoping that inspiration will come only to pick it up months later and still be at a loss after a few words or sentences.\nAnother possibility is that I got involved with my amazing wife, Sarah, around the same time as I published book number one and started working on book number two. Having a partner has brought immense joy into my life, but definitely limits some of my time that I previously spent creatively writing, lol. Was creative writing something I did because I was lonely before?? Who knows!\nWhatever the reasons, I\u0026rsquo;ve been very frustrated by my writers block for awhile now and haven\u0026rsquo;t figured out a way around it. Recently I was watching a very interesting YouTube video by NetworkChuck Starting a blog in 2024\r. The idea of mixing two of my interests, the technical data automation side, and the creative writing aspect peaked my interest.\nAnd boy, has it been interesting so far! NetworkChuck\u0026rsquo;s walkthrough video and his own blog post helped a ton, but there was definitely some technical troubleshooting that I had to do myself to get everything working as it should (and more to come, as you might notice, the logo on the website still isn\u0026rsquo;t loading). I will say that I am really liking Obsidian.md as a note and writing tool.\nSo, finally, what is the objective of the blog?\nWell, I\u0026rsquo;m going to give my self the objective of posting at least once a week in 2025, that\u0026rsquo;s 52 posts. Hopefully the act of writing, about whatever I feel like that week, will help the creative spark flourish in my other writing projects as well. Some might be a little technical, some might be about other crafty projects I\u0026rsquo;m working on, some might be creative writing\u0026hellip;the point is just to get back into writing!\nUntil next week and wishing everyone a good end of the year!\n-Sam\n","permalink":"/posts/reason-for-the-blog/","tags":["blog","first_post"],"title":"Reason for the Blog"},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"/manifest.json","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"/search/_index.de/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"/search/_index.es/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"/search/_index.fr/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"/search/_index.hi/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"/search/_index.jp/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"/search/_index.nl/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"/search/_index.pl/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"/search/_index.ru/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"/search/_index.zh-cn/","tags":null,"title":""}]
