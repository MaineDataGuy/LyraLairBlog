title: Men in the Night
Date: 2024-12-22
---
Dark shadows at the window<br/>
Dark houses are silent.<br/>
Dogs stop barking.<br/>
Wind stops blowing.<br/>
Figures keep coming.<br/>
Seconds take minutes<br/>
Minutes take hours<br/>
Hours take days.<br/>
Men in the night take people<br/>
Away… away,<br/>
To where they’ll never come back.<br/>
Men in the night keep coming.<br/>
<br/>
*Poem that I wrote many years ago*
