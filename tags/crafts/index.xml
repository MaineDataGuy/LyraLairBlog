      <description>&lt;p&gt;Short post this week, I spent the first couple days this week battling a headache that just wouldn&amp;rsquo;t go away!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, my creative drive was severely diminished.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I decided to end my week with a little project to do a heat transfer vinyl design on a shirt with the Cricut Explorer 3 that my amazing wife got me for Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I did a run to wally world to get a blank shirt (their plain t-shirt stock was surprisingly horrendous by the way&amp;hellip;definitely won&amp;rsquo;t be going there again any time soon!). Then I fired up the ol&amp;rsquo; Cricut design studio to figure out what I wanted. I had a basic idea from some inspiration I&amp;rsquo;ve seen around the interwebs, and the process was surprisingly painless.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
